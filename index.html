<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>In Light Of India</h2><p>&#x201c;One of the most brilliant and original essayists in any language&#x201d; (Washington Post Book World) reflects on the six years he spent in India as Mexican ambassador-and reveals how the people and culture of that extraordinary land changed his life. Translated by Eliot Weinberger.<br></p><p>Uncertainty stalks Octavio Paz. <i>In Light of India</i> is Paz's return to issues addressed in his poems of India that were inspired by his residence there three decades earlier. The paradoxes of a troubled nation are persistent, and Paz revisits the unfathomable facets of India with an eye on his Mexican homeland. Beneath the sensuous veneer of modern India lies a complex lattice of religious tendrils that reach into and influence Indian history, society, literature, and art. Paz follows these tendrils as well as anyone can, piecing together a nation of beauty, profundity, and enigma. Profundity aside, if Paz were writing about dust particles, he'd be worth reading.Octavio Paz was born in 1914 and died in 1998. The author of eighteen books, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990.</p><h2>Allan Holdsworth -- Just for the Curious: Book &amp; Online Audio (CPP Media Video Transcription Series)</h2><p>Based on the Allan Holdsworth REH video.

Step into the nightmare!<br><br>Mickey is put in charge of his vacationing neighbors' cat, Bella. His best friend Amanda comes along to help out.

What is he going to do? Amanda has an idea to replace the cat with a look-alike from the local pet store, Cat Heaven.

Their case studies reveal God's perspective on women, then and now.</p><p>Few biblical teachings have been as misunderstood and muddled by those inside and outside the church as its instruction concerning women. <em>Through His Eyes</em> answers the question "What does God think about women, and how does he treat them?" by walking readers through several biblical case studies.</p><p><em>Through His Eyes</em> begins with Eve and a series of Old Testament examples that demonstrate the respect God gives to women and their significant place in salvation history. In the New Testament we see how God blessed Mary by calling her to be the mother of our Savior and how beautifully Jesus treated women.</p><p>Here is a happy exposition of the dignity and glory the Lord showers on women. The author encourages women to delight in their creation and calling, and he challenges men to honor women as does the Lord himself.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jerram Barrs</strong> (MDiv, Covenant Theological Seminary) is the founder and resident scholar of the Francis A.

Dylan Thomas&#39;s lyrical account of his childhood Christmases in a small Welsh town, featuring wolves, bears, hippos and Mrs Prothero&#39;s cat, has become deservedly famous. This re-designed edition celebrates the centenary of his birth, and features brand-new artwork from illustrator Peter Bailey.</p><p><p>Dylan Thomas was born in 1914 in Swansea. During his lifetime he wrote many great poems, including 'Fern Hill', 'The Hunchback in the Park' and 'Do not go gentle into that good night'. He is also famous for writing UNDER MILK WOOD. Thomas died in 1953 in New York, one of Britain's best-loved writers.</p><p>Peter Bailey's illustrations are familiar from classics such as CIDER WITH ROSIE<i>.</i>His lovely line-drawing style lends itself to children's classics and he has worked with many of today's best-known children's authors, including Philip Pullman, Allan Ahlberg and Michael Morpurgo. Visit his illustration blog at peterbaileyillustrations.blogspot.co.uk.</p>Larger-than-life Dylan Thomas possessed a delicate aptness of detail in his writing, and his poetic sensibility shows in every crafted description in "A Child's Christmas in Wales." The story avoids sentiment or nostalgia and gets right to the sublime nature of new snow and mischief with friends and the difference between "useful gifts" (scratchy woolens) and the much more desirable useless ones (gobs of candy and perhaps a small ax). Thomas's deep, thunderous voice belies his sense of humor, which is amply evident in "A Child's Christmas." Caedmon's 1952 recording is without frills, but still a fine one, with a faint echo following each of Thomas's booming pronouncements, and the digitally remastered CD is a keepsake. The five poems are a bonus, and the stirring "Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night" might just be the perfect rumination for the cold, quiet nights creeping toward the new year.

Lamy's accomplishments, including the endowing of hospitals, orphanages, and English-language schools and colleges, formed the foundation of modern-day Santa Fe and often brought him into conflict with corrupt local priests. His life story, also the subject of Willa Cather's Death Comes for the Archbishop, describes a pivotal period in the American Southwest, as Spanish and Mexican rule gave way to much greater influence from the U.S. and Europe. Historian and consummate stylist Paul Horgan has given us a chronicle filled with hardy, often extraordinary adventure, and sustained by Lamy's magnificent strength of character.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. 20 illus.PAUL HORGAN (1904-1995) was a novelist, historian and biographer&#x2015;and one of the 20th century's most gifted authors.

That&#39;s because she&#39;s been kidnapped and taken to the set of Space Battle Lunchtime&#39;s biggest rival, Cannibal Coliseum, where chefs compete to cook... each other. Up against some of the most dangerous aliens in the galaxy, will Peony even make it to the end of the show? Stay tuned!</p><p><b>KIRKUS-</b>In this graphic-novel sequel, a human chef must battle her way out of a murderous intergalactic cooking show.<br><br>Diving right in where predecessor <i>Lights, Camera, Snacktion!</i> (2016) left off, this sequel finds Peony, an aspiring white earthling chef, double-crossed and kidnapped from the cooking show <i>Space Battle Lunchtime</i>. She's dropped onto the set of their sinister competitor, <i>Cannibal Coliseum</i>, where the contestants could literally become lunch. On the set, Peony meets one of her challengers, the very pink, wide-eyed, manga-styled, and adorably vicious unicorn Ariella Magicorn. As Peony tries to stay alive in the cutthroat kitchen, her friends from <i>Space Battle Lunchtime</i>-including the quietly intense, blue-skinned Neptunia, whose affections for Peony have now blossomed into a relationship-must save her before it's too late. Riess' candy-hued charmer is like a recipe that incorporates myriad ingredients: there's sci-fi elements, comedic action, a tentative and sweet queer intergalactic romance, and, of course, the culinary aspect. In less deft hands, this seemingly arbitrary assemblage could fall as flat as a dropped souffl�, but Riess' offbeat sensibility and inventiveness shine. Heavily awash in a spectrum of bubble-gum pinks, this is a fun, fierce, and inventive tale that will appeal to those seeking read-alikes for Noelle Stevenson's fan-favorites <i>Nimona</i> (2015) and <i>Lumberjanes</i>.<br><br>A genre-buster, for sure, and a delightful mashup at that. (Graphic science fiction. 12-adult)<br></p><h2>Pybrac</h2><p>By turns amusing and offensive, Pierre Lou�s&#x2019; <i>Pybrac</i> is possibly the filthiest collection of poetry ever published, and offers a taste of what the Marquis de Sade might have produced if he had ever turned his hand to verse. First published posthumously in 1927, <i>Pybrac</i> was, with <i>The Young Girl&#x2019;s Handbook of Good Manners</i>, one of the first of Lou�s&#x2019; secret erotic manuscripts to see clandestine publication. Composed of 313 rhymed alexandrine quatrains, the majority of them starting with the phrase "I do not like to see...," <i>Pybrac</i> is in form a mockery of sixteenth-century chancellor poet Guy Du Faur, Seigneur de Pibrac, whose moralizing quatrains were common literary fare for young French readers until the nineteenth century. Lou�s spent his life coming up with his own ever-growing collection of rhymed moral precepts (suitable only for adult readers): a dizzying litany describing everything he "disliked" witnessing, from lesbianism, sodomy, incest and prostitution to perversions extreme enough to give even a modern reader pause. With the rest of his erotic manuscripts, the original collection of over 2,000 quatrains was auctioned off and scattered throughout private collections; but like everything erotic, what remains, collected here, conveys an impression of unending absurdity and near-hypnotic obsession.</p><p></p><h2>Don&#39;t Hide the Madness: William S. Burroughs in Conversation with Allen Ginsberg</h2><p>Two seminal figures of the Beat movement, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, discuss literary influences and personal history in a never-before-published three-day conversation following the release of the David Cronenberg film of Burroughs&#x2019; classic novel <i>Naked Lunch</i>. The visit coincided with the shamanic exorcism of the demon that Burroughs believed had caused him to fatally shoot his common law wife, Joan Vollmer Burroughs, in 1951&#x2015;the event that Burroughs believed had driven his work as a writer. The conversation is interspersed with photographs by Ginsberg revealing Burroughs&#x2019;s daily activities from his painting studio to the shooting range. <b>DON'T HIDE THE MADNESS</b> presents an important, hitherto unpublished primary document of the Beat Generation.</p><p><b>William S. Burroughs</b> was a primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author whose influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas, including <i>Naked Lunch</i>, <i>Junky</i>, and <i>Queer</i>. <i>Naked Lunch</i> was adapted for the screen in the 1991 award-winning film directed by David Cronenberg. American poet, philosopher, and photographer <b>Allen Ginsberg</b> is considered to be one of the leading figures of both the Beat Generation during the 1950s and the counterculture that soon followed. Among his many published poetry collections, he is best known for <i>Howl and Other Poems</i>, <i>Kaddish and Other Poems</i>, and <i>Collected Poems, 1947-1997</i>. Poet, musician, and ethnomusicologist <b>Steven Taylor</b> toured extensively with Allen Ginsberg from 1976 to 1996, collaborating on music and poetry works. Taylor is a member of the seminal underground rock band The Fugs, and is author of two books of poems and the musical ethnography, <i>False Prophet: Field Notes from the Punk Underground</i>. From 1990 to 2008 he was on the faculty at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University. Currently, he is senior editor at <i>Reality Sandwich</i>. He lives in Brooklyn, NY."Lightly but helpfully annotated and peppered with Ginsberg&#x2019;s own snapshots of Burroughs in repose, this must-have resource for beat aficionados will stimulate more casual readers as well with its sense of being in the same room, and thoroughly in tune, with two legendary literary iconoclasts." <b><i>&#x2015;Publishers Weekly</i></b> <br> <br> &#x201c;Invaluable to scholars and avid readers who yearn to understand the original Beats.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2015;Rain Taxi</i></b> <br> <br> &#x201c;Devotees of these Beat Generation icons will find these conversations between longtime friends both entertaining and revealing.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2015;Library Journal</i></b> <br> <br> &#x201c;For aficionados of these two literary lights and the Beat movement in general, this is an illuminating artifact and essential addition to the collection.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2015;Washington Independent Review of Books</i></b> <br> <br> "[An] intimate, sprawling exchange." <b><i>The Paris Review</i></b> <br> <br> &#x201c;Anyone with an interest in these two seminal figures of the Beat movement will like to follow along with the free-flowing discussion.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2015;Seattle Book Review</i></b> <br> <br> &#x201c;A deeply personal and beautiful book. . . .

Woody was apparently too busy for introductions. My instructions were to run out of a building, through a crowd, and into a strange car. When Woody called 'Action,' I opened the car door, jumped in, and landed smack on William Powell's lap. He looked up nonchalantly: 'Miss Loy, I presume?' I said, 'Mr. Powell?' And that's how I met the man who would be my partner in fourteen films.&#x201d; &#x2013; Myrna Loy<br>It is something of a clich� to say that an actor&#x2019;s life was like a movie he or she might have starred in, but in the case of Myrna Loy, the clich� is true. It is easy to picture her as a little girl, riding the range with her rancher father, sitting around the table and participating charmingly in family discussions of current events. It is not hard to imagine the camera panning to her first and then second visits to Hollywood, her backlot tour, and starry-eyed decision to become an actress. There would have to be some drama, which the story of her father&#x2019;s untimely death would provide, along with some sort of deathbed promise made to him to care for the rest of the family. Her mother would be brave but resolute as she moved her young family to California. The lighting on set would brighten and the tempo of the background would pick up as she walked down the Los Angeles streets.<br>Perhaps the camera would spin to show the passage of time, as the now adult Myrna got a job as a dancer and was then &#x201c;discovered.&#x201d; There would have to be a scene of her signing her new surname, Loy, to her MGM contract, likely as several cigar smoking men looked on. Later the audience would see her fight off casting couch advances, earning her the reputation as the only good girl in Hollywood even as she was cast again and again in sultry, vampish roles. She would endure these with a positive attitude while always being on the lookout for something better. <br>Then, her big break would come. The camera would show her first comical meeting with William Powell and then a spinning scene of ticket after ticket being sold to their new picture, The Thin Man. Her star obviously on the rise, ominous music would suddenly play, followed by booming cannons and falling bombs. A newspaper would flash on screen, &#x201c;Pearl Harbor Bombed.&#x201d; Then the audience would see her stride determinedly into the movie studio offices and announce to those above that her love of country superseded her career ambitions and that she would be taking the duration of the war off from making pictures. Patriotic music would play as she was shown gathering clothing and giving speeches until, once more, the boys came marching home.<br>In the 1920s, the burgeoning movie industry was starting to come into its own, and while older silent film stars like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton reached the peak of Hollywood, some actors born near the beginning of the 20th century were ready to capitalize. While actors like Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant remain household names, and actresses like Greta Garbo are still widely remembered, few had careers that enjoyed the success of William Powell.<br>In a career spanning several decades, Powell would receive three Oscar nominations for Best Actor for critically acclaimed movies, so it is somewhat ironic that he is mostly remembered today for his association with the more famous Myrna Loy. Together, they starred in 14 films, including the 1934 box office hit, The Thin Man. <br>One thing that helped Powell&#x2019;s career along in the old days when Hollywood would only cast white actors in major roles, no matter what the nationality of the character was supposed to be, were his dark good looks.</p><p></p><h2>D.

One of the largest and most violent revolts in the history of the young nation, the rebellion took the lives of some sixty white men, women, and children. An outcry against the South's exploitative slave system, the revolt was suppressed within forty-eight hours,&nbsp;and Turner, who eluded authorities for months, was eventually captured, sentenced to death, and executed.<br>The impact of Turner's uprising was monumental. Abolitionists looked for ways to encourage and support future insurrections while white Southerners took revenge on both slave and free African-Americans. Nearly 200 blacks, many of whom had nothing to do with the rebellion, were beaten, tortured, and murdered by white mobs.<br>Herbert Aptheker's account of the bloodiest slave uprising in U.S. history was the first full-length study of its kind. Meticulously researched, it explores the nature of Southern society in the early nineteenth century and the conditions that led to the rebellion. Described by the <i>Journal of American History </i>as "a thorough and scholarly treatment," the text includes Turner's "Confessions," recorded before his execution in 1831. Plus, the events in this book helped inspire the acclaimed 2016 movie <i>Birth of a Nation</i>.</p><p></p><h2>The Jekyll Revelation</h2><p><p><b>A spellbinding thriller from the bestselling author of <i>The Einstein Prophecy</i>.</b></p><p>A chilling curse is transported from 1880s London to present-day California, awakening a long-dormant fiend.</p><p>While on routine patrol in the tinder-dry Topanga Canyon, environmental scientist Rafael Salazar expects to find animal poachers, not a dilapidated antique steamer trunk.

Two centuries ago, however, its economy sank into a depression from which it had not fully recovered&#x2014;until now. China's modern resurgence as the world's largest nation in terms of population and its second-largest economy&#x2014;where 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty in the space of a few decades&#x2014;is the greatest untold story of the 21st century.<br><br><i>A Brief History of China</i> tells of the development of a rich and complex civilization where the use of paper, writing, money and gunpowder were widespread in ancient times and where silk, ceramics, tea, metal implements and other products were produced and exported around the globe. It examines the special conditions that allowed a single culture to unify an entire continent spanning 10 billion square kilometers under the rule of a single man&#x2014;and the unbelievably rich artistic, literary and architectural heritage that Chinese culture has bequeathed to the world. Equally fascinating is the story of China's decline in the 19th and early 20th century&#x2014;as Europeans and Americans took center stage&#x2014;and its modern resurgence as an economic powerhouse in recent years. <br><br>In his retelling of a Chinese history stretching back 5,000 years, author and China-expert Jonathan Clements focuses on the human stories which led to the powerful transformations in Chinese society&#x2014;from the unification of China under its first emperor, Qinshi Huangdi, and the writings of the great Chinese philosophers Confucius and Laozi, to the Mongol invasion under Genghis Khan and the consolidation of Communist rule under Mao Zedong. Clements even brings readers through to the present day, outlining China's economic renaissance under Deng Xiaoping and Xi Jinping.<br><br> What really separates this book from its counterparts is the focus on women, and modern themes such as diversity and climate change. Chinese history is typically told through the stories of its most famous men, but Clements' telling gives women equal time and research&#x2014;which introduces readers of this book to equally important, but less commonly-known facts and historical figures.<br><br>Often seen in the West in black or white terms&#x2014;as either a savage dystopia or a fantastical paradise&#x2014;China is revealed in the book as an exceptional yet troubled nation that nevertheless warrants its self-description as the Middle Kingdom.</p><p><b>Jonathan Clements</b> is the author of <i>Christ's Samurai: The True Story of the Shimabara Rebellion, A Brief History of the Samurai, Modern Japan: All That Matters, Anime: A History</i> and biographies of Admiral Togo and Prince Saionji Kinmochi. In 2016 he became the presenter of <i>Route Awakening</i> (National Geographic)&#x2014;a TV series on historical icons of Chinese culture."...a powerful, engaging and balanced account of the vast span of China's history...The reader can approach this book with confidence and&#x2014;thanks to its well-chosen reading recommendations&#x2014;use it as a springboard for deeper engagement with China, its culture and its people." <b>&#x2014;Ellis Tinios, Honorary Lecturer in East Asian History, University of Leeds</b><br><br>"<i>A Brief History of China</i> is a pacy romp through China's long and layered history that successfully walks the tightrope of the scholarly and the entertaining. In brisk, engaging prose, Clements covers this book's vast territory with authority." <b>&#x2014;Pallavi Aiyar, Author of <i>Smoke and Mirrors: An Experience of China</i></b><br><br>"A go-to guide for anyone seeking to get up to speed on China quickly. With a focus on memorable characters and stories, <i>A Brief History of China</i> is ideal for tourists, students and businesspeople looking to understand this emerging superpower." <b>&#x2014;Julie Makinen, former China Bureau Chief, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br>"Jonathan Clements' deep knowledge of the subject and his lively, entertaining style are here combined to produce something quite remarkable: a history that is indeed brief and yet surprisingly comprehensive. Somehow, as you are carried along on the tide of his absorbing narrative, you are convinced that nothing meaningful has been left out. Here is China in all its glory." <b>&#x2014;Stephen Turnbull, Author of <i>The Great Wall of China</i></b><br><br>"Clements tackles more than 5,000 years of Chinese history in an agile but comprehensible narrative of the Heavenly Kingdom. Useful for the general reader, the book has special value for the business person looking to understand the single largest commercial market in the world." <b>&#x2014;Alfonso Asensio, Author of <i>World Wide Data</i> and <i>Chief Kickboxing Officer</i></b><br><br>"Clements' spare prose, bad-boy wit and encyclopedic knowledge of Asian facts, gossip and trivia put paid to any misgivings about uttering 'history' and 'page-turner' in the same breath. This succinct chronicle of China's rise to global power is essential reading for businessmen, politicians and creatives." <b>&#x2014;J. Christopher Westland, Author of <i>Red Wired: China's Internet Revolution</i> and <i>Overseas Chair Professor</i> / Thousand-Talents Plan Scholar at Beihang University</b><br><br>"Clements brings to light the voices of the hidden and the marginalised, through snapshots of real people, and readings between the lines of poetry, historical records, and contemporary literature. He pays particular attention to women, uncovering their often-buried impact on China's past, and...takes China's history back to its diverse human core, immersing booklovers in a vast cast of characters and a gripping narrative, effortlessly easy to enjoy." &#x2014;<b>Roxy Simons, <i>AllTheAnime</i></b><br><br>"Where was this book a decade ago, when I landed in China and needed a crash course on the country and the culture? With humor, respect, and a deft hand, Clements simplifies the complicated politics of 5,000 years of history and makes it accessible. He highlights and humanizes the most formative events and the people involved, so as not to overwhelm readers, and gives us insight into how events that happened long ago still resonate today." <b>&#x2014;Alicia Noel, Founder &amp; CEO, Cultivati Inc.</b></p><h2>Disturbing His Peace: The Academy (The Academy, 3)</h2><p><p><strong><em>She&#x2019;s got probable cause to make her move . . . </em></strong></p><p>Danika Silva can&#x2019;t stand Lt.

She&nbsp;lives and works in upstate New York.Revenge of the Spellmans THE PHILOSOPHER&#x2019;S CLUB<p></p> Tuesday<p></p> <br>An unknown male&#x2014;approximately fifty-five years old, with an almost full head of gray hair, a slight build, an even slighter paunch, and a weathered but friendly face, garbed in a snappy suit and a not-unpleasant tie&#x2014;walked into the bar. He sat down at the counter and nodded a silent hello.<br> <br>&#x201c;What can I get you?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Coffee,&#x201d; Unknown Male replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Irish coffee?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope. Just the regular stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, they got coffee shops, if you&#x2019;re into that sort of thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s three in the afternoon,&#x201d; Unknown Male replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s still a bar,&#x201d; I responded, and poured a mug of the stale brew. &#x201c;Cream and sugar?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Black,&#x201d; he answered. Unknown Male took a sip and grimaced. He pushed the mug back in my direction and said, &#x201c;Cream and sugar.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thought so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Unknown Male put a five-dollar bill on the bar and told me to keep the change. I rang two dollars into the cash register and put the remaining three into the tip jar.<br> <br>&#x201c;You Isabel?&#x201d; Unknown Male asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s asking?&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ernest Black,&#x201d; the less-unknown male said, stretching out his hand. &#x201c;My friends call me Ernie.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook it, because that&#x2019;s what you do, and then picked up a dishrag and began drying some glasses, because that&#x2019;s what bartenders do.<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard you used to be a detective,&#x201d; Ernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you hear that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was in here the other day talking to Milo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You and Milo friends?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not enemies. Anyway, Milo said you used to be a detective.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Private investigator,&#x201d; I corrected him, and dried some more glasses.<br> <br>There was a long pause while Ernie tried to figure out how to keep the conversation going.<br> <br>&#x201c;It looks like you&#x2019;re a bartender now,&#x201d; Ernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;So it seems.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this like a career path or more like a rest stop on a longer journey?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; I said, even though I understood what Ernie was getting at.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just wondering, are you planning on doing this bartender thing long-term or do you think you might go back into the PI business somewhere down the line?&#x201d;<br> <br>I casually put down the glass and the dishrag. I reached over the bar and grabbed Ernie by the not-unpleasant tie he was wearing and leaned in close enough to smell his stale coffee breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell my mother that if she wants to know my plans for the future, she should ask me herself!&#x201d;<br> Wednesday<p></p> <br>My dad walked into the bar. Albert SpellmanI is his name. I&#x2019;d been expecting him. Three o&#x2019;clock on Wednesday is his usual time. He likes an empty bar so he can speak freely.<br> <br>&#x201c;The usual,&#x201d; Dad said, mostly because he likes feeling like a regular. Dad&#x2019;s usual is a five-ounce glass of red wine. He&#x2019;d rather order a beer or whiskey or both, but his heart condition and my mother prohibit all of the above.<br> <br>I poured the wine, slid the glass in his direction, leaned on top of the bar, and looked my dad in the eye.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom sent some guy into the bar yesterday to pump me for information.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, she didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Dad said, looking bored.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, she did,&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isabel, she did that one time two months ago and she never did it again. I promise you.&#x201d;II<br> <br>&#x201c;You have no idea what she&#x2019;s doing when you&#x2019;re not watching her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You could say that about anyone,&#x201d; Dad said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m talking about Mom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to change the subject, Isabel.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sighed, disappointed. I was not interested in the subject my dad had in mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;d like to talk about the weather, I&#x2019;d be alright with that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not the weather,&#x201d; said Dad.<br> <br>&#x201c;Seen any good movies?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t been getting out much lately,&#x201d; Dad said, &#x201c;what with work and all. Oh yes. Work. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d like to talk about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about work.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t talk. You just listen. Can you do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I distinctly recall you telling me that I wasn&#x2019;t a good listener,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;So, apparently I cannot do that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isabel!&#x201d; Dad said far too loudly, but who cares in an empty bar? &#x201c;We are having this conversation whether you like it or not.&#x201d;<br> <br>In case you were thinking the definition had changed, a conversation usually involves two people exchanging words, a back-and-forth, if you will. My dad provided a brief lecture that went something like this:<br> <br>&#x201c;You are a licensed private investigator. That is your trade. And yet, for the last five months, all you have done is serve drinks and collect tips.III You have refused to work at a job for which you are highly qualified, which used to give you some real purpose in life. I spent seven long, hard years training you at that job, teaching you everything I know while you talked back, nodded off, screwed up, broke equipment, slammed my hand in a car door,IV lost me clients, and cost me a fortune in car insurance. Seven long years, Isabel. I can&#x2019;t get those years back. They&#x2019;re lost to me forever. Do you know how much more pleasant it would have been to have hired a nice responsible college student looking for a little excitement in his or her life? Someone who didn&#x2019;t insult my intelligence on a daily basis or leave cigarette butts and empty beer cans in the surveillance van, someone who said &#x2018;Yes, Mr. Spellman&#x2019; instead of rolling her eyes and grunting? Can you imagine how my life might be different?V How my health might be improved?VI Five months ago, when you took this &#x2018;temporary&#x2019;VII job, you promised your mother and me that you would start actively thinking about your future, which is directly connected to our future, because it&#x2019;s connected to the future of this business we have built not just for us, but for you. So, tell me, Isabel, after five months of serving drinks and over two months of seeing a shrink, are you any closer to making that decision?&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not usually one who follows the adage &#x201c;Honesty is the best policy,&#x201d; but my dad&#x2019;s speech exhausted even me, and so I decided to go with the very short truth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Dad sucked the last drop of alcohol out of his wineglass. He searched the empty bar as if he were looking for assistance. He made brief eye contact, but he couldn&#x2019;t hold it. The disappointment was evident. Even I felt some sympathy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds like you could use a real drink, Dad,&#x201d; I said as I poured him a shot of Maker&#x2019;s Mark. &#x201c;This will be our little secret.&#x201d;<br> Thursday<p></p> <br>Thursday is my day off. I wake, read the paper, and drink coffee until noon. Maybe run an errand or two and surf the Internet, prowling for sites that amuse and educate. I kill time until I meet my oldVIII friend MortyIX for lunch. We used to meet at the same Jewish deli every Thursday, until I explained that, as a nonsenior citizen, I am not obsessed with maintaining unbreakable habits. Morty argued that he wanted to go to the same deli every week because he knew he liked the food and could be sure of an enjoyable meal. I argued that it&#x2019;s better to mix things up. And won. A good thing, as I was getting seriously tired of Morty trying to convince me to get the tongue sandwich.<br> <br>This week I persuaded Morty to meet me at Fog City DinerX on Battery Street downtown. I took public transportation, but Morty drove his giant Cadillac and was at least twenty minutes late.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where were you?&#x201d; I asked when he finally sat down at the booth. Morty is typically five minutes early for everything, so it was the obvious question.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got lost on the way over,&#x201d; Morty said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you have a navigation system.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I turned it off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand that thing. Always barking orders at me.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Morty studied the menu with his usual dedication, I studied Morty with a more critical eye than usual.<br> <br>The third button from the top dangled from his threadbare cotton shirt. The lapel sported a food stain. His hair appeared stringier than usual and his glasses reflected like a car windshield after a brief drizzle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hand over your glasses,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But then I can&#x2019;t see the menu,&#x201d; he replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to order a tuna melt and a cup of decaf like you always do in restaurants that don&#x2019;t serve pastrami.&#x201d;<br> <br>I held out the palm of my hand until Morty relinquished his eyewear. I dipped my napkin in my ice water and cleared the grime from the lenses. I returned his glasses and warned Morty that driving under such a condition was highly dangerous. Morty nodded in agreement the way somebody does when he wants you to stop talking. The waitress swung by our table and took our orders. Morty opted for the meat loaf and gave me a smirk of rebellion. He still ordered decaf, though.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s Ruth doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine, I suppose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As her husband, shouldn&#x2019;t that be something you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s in Florida for the week.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Doing what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Visiting her sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you go with her?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s with the third degree?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m making conversation, Morty. These are all reasonable questions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not moving to Florida!&#x201d; Morty suddenly shouted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who said you were moving there?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no way in hell.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Now let&#x2019;s change the subject.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does Ruth want to move to Florida?&#x201d; I asked, not changing the subject at all.<br> <br>&#x201c;She wanted to move to Italy twenty years ago and that didn&#x2019;t happen,&#x201d; was his response.<br> <br>&#x201c;What have you got against Florida?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get me started,&#x201d; Morty replied.<br> <br>The conversation pretty much ended there. Morty picked at his meat loaf and sulked his way through lunch.<br> <br>As we exited the diner Morty offered me a ride home and I accepted. I noticed a dent on his Cadillac&#x2019;s front left fender and asked what happened. He shrugged his shoulders in a What-difference-does-it make? kind of way. He then pulled out of the parking space without checking his rearview mirror and just missed a cyclist who swerved in the nick of time. Morty didn&#x2019;t notice a thing. A few minutes later, he completely ignored a stop sign, and a short time after that, he started two-lane driving on Van Ness Avenue, until someone in a Mini Cooper laid into the horn. Morty&#x2019;s response was, &#x201c;Relax, we&#x2019;ll all get there eventually.&#x201d;<br> <br>After Morty dropped me at the house, I debated how soon I should contact the authorities. If today was an accurate representation of Morty&#x2019;s driving, he was a regular menace to society. I opted to give him one more chance; everybody has an off day.<br> Friday<p></p> <br>A middle-age man walked into the bar followed by a teenage girl. The man appeared angry, the teenager defiant. Meet my sister, Rae, and her &#x201c;best friend,&#x201d; Henry Stone.XI<br> <br>Three bar stools divided them. Henry unrolled the New Yorker magazine he was carrying under his arm and began reading. Rae dusted off the already-dusted-off counter and said, &#x201c;The usual.&#x201d; Her usual is a ginger ale followed by a reminder that she&#x2019;s not actually supposed to be in a bar since she&#x2019;s only sixteen (and a half!) years old. I poured Rae&#x2019;s ginger ale and served Henry his usual club soda. I waited for the unusual stretch of silence to end. Rae watched Henry out of the corner of her eye. He studied his magazine with rapt attention, uninterested in&#x2014;or at least pretending quite well to be uninterested in&#x2014;the rest of the room. As an act of what appeared to be mimicry, Rae pulled out her geometry textbook and gave a performance of rapt attention. Hers failed where Henry&#x2019;s succeded. She checked him out of the corner of her eye, waiting for some acknowledgment of her presence. Rae downed her ginger ale and smacked the glass on the counter, making her presence impossible to ignore.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have another,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does somebody want to tell me what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; I asked as I served her second round.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing. Henry just needs to chillax,&#x201d; said Rae.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you have any response to that?&#x201d; I asked Henry.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isabel,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;this is a bar. Not a soda shop. Adults come here to get away from children. I could have you shut down for serving minors.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Rae, go home,&#x201d; I said, sensing that Henry needed some space.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; was Rae&#x2019;s response.<br> <br>&#x201c;I tried,&#x201d; I said, turning back to Henry.<br> <br>Henry finished his club soda and asked for something stronger. I suggested 7UP, but he had bourbon in mind, which meant my sister had done something terribly wrong. I was intrigued.<br> <br>&#x201c;What did you do?&#x201d; I asked Rae after I served Henry his Bulleit.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell Henry,&#x201d; Rae said, &#x201c;that what I did, I did for his own good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you hear that?&#x201d; I said to Henry.<br> <br>He looked up from the magazine and said, &#x201c;Hear what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, Rae said that what she did, she did for your own good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you can tell your sister that it was not her decision to make.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d; Rae asked, even though Henry&#x2019;s response was perfectly audible.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding me, right?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d; she insisted.<br> <br>&#x201c;He said it was not your decision to make.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell him he&#x2019;ll thank me later.&#x201d;<br> <br>Henry returned to his magazine and continued pretending that Rae existed in some parallel universe where only I could see and hear her. I decided to play along for the time being, since I had to admit I wanted the scoop.<br> <br>&#x201c;She said you&#x2019;ll thank her later.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell her I won&#x2019;t. Tell her she&#x2019;s forbidden to come to my house ever again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be serious,&#x201d; she said. Apparently my translating skills were no longer required, because this was directed at Henry&#x2019;s back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m very serious,&#x201d; he replied, finishing off the last of his bourbon. I was shocked when he pointed to his glass and asked for another, but I assumed this meant further information would be forthcoming, so I served the drink and eagerly awaited the rest of the story.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll spare you the long, drawn-out argument and give you the basic facts. Henry, for the last five months, had been dating a public defender for San Francisco County named Maggie Mason. Maggie has an apartment in Daly City&#x2014;not the quickest commute to the superior court building on Bryant Street. Henry lives in the Inner Sunset. It&#x2019;s only natural that Maggie would spend time at Henry&#x2019;s home and not the other way around. Two months ago, she got a drawer in his house; one month ago, she got a shelf in his pantry.XII Last week Henry made a copy of his key and gave it to her in a jewelry box. My sister, convinced that Henry wasn&#x2019;t really ready to take the next step, took it upon herself to change the locks in his apartment a few days later. How my sister had access to his home and how this act of subterfuge went unnoticed by the neighbors, I cannot explain. Suffice it to say she did not deny her role in this particular drama. I&#x2019;m sure you can imagine what happened next: Maggie arrived at Henry&#x2019;s house after a long day of work. She tried her key and it failed. She interpreted events the way any woman might: Henry gave her the wrong key, which was a subconscious or passive-aggressive communication that he was simply not ready. What had not occurred to Maggie was that my sister was playing saboteur in their relationship.

When it was first published in &#34;The New Yorker&#34; in 1950 it was an immediate sensation and prompted a flood of readers&#39; fan-letters. &#39;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&#39; is the first of the author&#39;s stories to feature the Glass family, the loveable and idiosyncratic family who would appear in much of Salinger&#39;s later fiction.

Salinger was born in 1919 and died in January 2010. He grew up in New York City, and wrote short stories from an early age, but his breakthrough came in 1948 with the publication in the New Yorker of &#39;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&#39;. The Catcher in the Rye was his first and only novel, published in 1951. It remains one of the most translated, taught and reprinted texts, and has sold some 65 million copies. Salinger also wrote several novellas and short stories, including Franny and Zooey, For Esme - With Love and Squalor, and Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction.</p><h2>Tree of Enchantment: Ancient Wisdom and Magic Practices of the Faery Tradition</h2><p>In Faery Seership the truths we seek can only be found within ourselves, within nature, and within our relationships to nature. At the center of the Faery Tradition lies the Tree of Enchantment: the symbol for these relationships and for the threefold life of humanity. At each level of the tree, there are attending spirit forces that vary from beings of light to beings of shadow, from the ancestors of humanity to the architects of form and nature, from the destiny of our planet to the creation forces of the universe. The tree�&#39;s roots grow through the lower world, where all life originates and the dead travel, its trunk and lower branches reach out across the middle world, where elemental forces and the four directions guide us, and its highest branches reach the into the upper world and the Star realm. Weaving together folk tradition and extensive academic research, Orion Foxwood has created an accessible, beautifully written pathway into the Old Religion of Faery Seership. Based on Appalachian traditions, Wiccan studies, Celtic oral traditions, and the Craft from Western and Northern Europe, The Tree of Enchantment offers the student of Faery Tradition both introductory and advanced visionary practices and authentic tools to learn to navigate the three realms of humanity. With diligence and an open heart, the reader will learn to cross The River of Blood, pass through The Gate of Awakening, and over The River of Stars.</p><p>Orion Foxwood was born with the second sight in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, area rife with the folk practices of the southern and Appalachian tradition. He lectures in across the United States and the U.K."<i>The Tree of Enchantment</i> is an important and profound work written by one of the most significant authors of this genre today. This book offers insights and techniques that can come only from deep levels of direct experience and the wisdom that results from personal effort. I highly recommend The Tree of Enchantment" -Raven Grimassi<br><br>"In <i>The Tree of Enchantment</i>, my dear friend Lord Orion Foxwood offers a brilliant and inspiring synthesis of the most universal premises underlying the world-views of magickal cultures throughout the world--especially those associated with the realms that in Western tradition are called "Faery." The seed of these precepts is the metaphor of the Tree, with its three components: branches reaching into the World Above; roots delving into the World Below, and the trunk connecting these in the Middle World. Through engaging parables, charts, images and poetry, Lord Foxwood expands and applies this metaphor to all aspects of creation--revealing our own human origins, place, and destiny therein." -Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, author of <i>Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard</i><br><br>"Orion Foxwood is a seer whose message--our human soul and the soul of the Earth are as one--is much needed in these times of change and possibility." --T. Thorn Coyle, teacher and author of <i>Evolutionary Witchcraft</i> and <i>Kissing the Limitless</i><br><br>"Orion Foxwood sees discontent as the prod that sets you on the quest for your divine heritage and purpose. In <i>The Tree of Enchantment</i>, Foxwood offers well-seasoned visualizations and exercises that will open gateways connecting your human self to Nature and to the three dimensions of reality. I recommend this book as a valuable guide to aligning yourself with the Tree in the three realms and, thus, to awakening the creative self that helps you fulfill your spiritual destiny." -Mary K. Greer, author of <i>21 Ways to Read a Tarot Card</i><br><br>"<i>TheTree of Enchantment</i> is a rare and beautiful piece of esoteric writing that is fresh, vibrant, and ready for this age and those to come. It is a true guide for helping mend the rifts and fractures within the self and between the planes of being." -Ivo Dominguez, Jr., author of <i>Spirit Speak, Castings: The Creation of Sacred Space</i>, and <i>Beneath The Skins</i><br><br>"A truly enchanting gateway into a authentic spiritual tradition guided by the spirits, with roots deep in the Earth and a true understanding of the stars.

The magical and healing power of our incarnations arise not only from transcendental levels but from our roots in the earth, in our lineages, and in our ancestors.&nbsp; Orion's book provides a&nbsp;powerful path into these roots and then out&nbsp;to the flowering of an eco-spirituality and an eco-magic that cannot help but bring blessings to our planet." -David Spangler, author of <i>Blessing: The Art and the Practice</i><br><br>"I say this with the deepest conviction and without a tinge of hyperbole; Orion Foxwood is a national treasure. His <i>Tree of Enchantment</i> is a brilliant and elegant jewel of modern magical literature and a testament to his genius and insight." -Lon Milo DuQuette, author of <i>Enochian Vision Magick</i><br><br>"In this fascinating and educational work, Orion Foxwood provides a comprehensive course of study that puts new focus on ancient Faery traditions. The book leads the seeker from the seed of The Tree of Enchantment (that seed is universal divine discontent) to the culmination of truth and satisfaction found within each and every one of us. The journey is a true delight, giving new dimensions to ancient traditions.

With <i>Hotspur</i>, we return to the Southern chase&#x2013;and to a hunt on the trail of a murderer.<br></b><br>Jane &#x201c;Sister&#x201d; Arnold may be in her seventies, but she shows no signs of losing her love for the Hunt. As Master of the prestigious Jefferson Hunt Club in a well-heeled Virginia Blue Ridge Mountain town, she is the most powerful and revered woman in the county. She can assess the true merits of a man or a horse with uncanny skill. In short, Sister Jane is not easily duped.<br><br>When the skeleton of Nola Bancroft, still wearing an exquisite sapphire ring on her finger, is unearthed, it brings back a twenty-one year old mystery. Beautiful Nola was a girl who had more male admirers than her family had money, which was certainly quite a feat. In a world where a woman&#x2019;s ability to ride was considered one of her most important social graces, Nola was queen of the stable. She had a weakness for men, and her tastes often ventured towards the inappropriate, like the sheriff&#x2019;s striking son, Guy Ramy. But even Guy couldn&#x2019;t keep her eyes from wandering.<br><br>When Nola and Guy disappeared on the Hunt&#x2019;s ceremonial first day of cubbing more than two decades ago, everyone assumed one of two things: Guy and Nola eloped to escape her family&#x2019;s disapproval; or Guy killed Nola in a jealous rage and vanished. But Sister Jane had never bought either of those theories.<br>Sister knows that all the players are probably still in place, the old feuds haven&#x2019;t died, and the sparks that led to a long-ago murder could flare up at any time. <br><br><i>Hotspur</i> brings all of Rita Mae Brown&#x2019;s storytelling gifts to the fore. It&#x2019;s a tale of Southern small-town manners and rituals, a compelling and intricate murder mystery, and a look at the human/animal relationship in all its complexity and charm.</p><p><b>Rita Mae Brown&nbsp;</b>is the bestselling author of the Sneaky Pie Brown series; the Sister Jane series;&nbsp;<i>A Nose for Justice&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Murder Unleashed; Rubyfruit Jungle; In Her Day;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Six of One,&nbsp;</i>as well as several other novels. An Emmy-nominated screenwriter and a poet, Brown lives in Afton, Virginia.A wind devil swirled upward, sending tiny bits of stone dust glittering in the sunlight. <br><br>Even though it was the fourteenth of July, the morning proved breezy and quite pleasant at sixty-one degrees.<br><br>The staff and friends of the Jefferson Hunt were walking out hounds. Since it was seven-thirty in the morning, "dedicated friends" was perhaps a more accurate term, Sister thought to herself. The master, Jane Arnold, called Sister by all, walked behind her pack. The huntsman, Shaker Crown, a medium-build fellow, strode in front of the hounds. <br><br>Two whippers-in, Doug Kinser and Betty Franklin, flanked either side of the pack, and the dedicated friends, two this morning, tagged behind the master. <br><br>This two-mile walk down a crushed gravel road served to exercise hounds and to introduce the young entry, those hounds that would be hunting this fall for the first time, to the ways of the pack. As the summer progressed and the length of the walks became longer, fat melted off the human bodies. People looked healthier, more fit.<br><br>It amused Sister that millions of Americans, overweight and overfed, emptied their pockets on one fad diet after another. If they'd only make it a habit to walk out hounds they'd lose the pounds, save their money, and experience the most beautiful time of the day. <br><br>On any given morning, Sister saw bluebirds, indigo buntings, goldfinches, cardinals, robins, ravens, and hawks roaring over in search of breakfast-or maybe just a good time. <br><br>Rabbits, moles, shrews, even wild little sleek minks rustled in the meadows off the roadside. <br><br>Safe in the trees, cicadas, their Winston Churchill eyes surveying all, sang with deafening exuberance. <br><br>Clouds of black and yellow butterflies swirled up from the cow patties and horse patties dotting the verdant pastures of After All Farm, the glorious estate of Theodora and Edward Bancroft. Gleaming white fences, painted every two years, divided the pastures, and each fence line boasted a lovely coop or stone jump. Theodora, called Tedi, delighted in designing jumps and set them perfectly. Building the jumps seemed to give the wealthy but directionless woman something like a purpose in life. <br><br>As the small group walked briskly past the western pastures of After All, three old pensioners lifted their wise heads. Peppermint, the oldest at thirty-four, had taught two generations of Bancrofts to hunt. <br><br>From the other side of the pasture he nickered in acknowledgment of the humans and hounds he knew so well. Behind him Domino and Merry Andrew also stopped munching for a moment. In the background a pristine covered bridge crossed over Snake Creek. Tedi had built it in the heat of one of her architectural enthusiasms back in 1981.<br><br>"Hello, old man," Sister called, waving to the gray horse.<br><br>"Good to see you, too," Peppermint answered before turning to drink deeply from the creek. <br><br>"Good horse never forgets the pack or the master," Shaker called over his shoulder. <br><br>"Indeed," Betty Franklin agreed with a smile. She was the happiest she'd ever been in her life. She'd lost twenty-five pounds and felt like a teenager again. <br><br>Cora, the head bitch, gaily walked in front, and the young entry following tried to imitate their leader. The second-year hounds acted like the sophomores they were. Truly "wise idiots," they at least knew better than to float out of the pack. <br><br>As they walked, the hounds kicked up little puffs of gravel dust. Inquisitive grasshoppers flew tantalizingly close to their black moist noses, darting away in the nick of time. <br><br>Raleigh, Sister's devoted Doberman, flattened his ears to block out the din of the hounds. He considered himself hunt staff and if a youngster strayed from the group Raleigh pushed him back in before a human could react. Hounds, like humans, thought the better of getting into an argument with a Doberman. <br><br>Dr. Walter Lungrun, young, blond, and athletic, was walking next to Bobby Franklin, who was huffing and puffing. <br><br>"Goddamn that Betty," Bobby said, cursing his wife loudly. "Told me if I don't do hound walk and lose fifty pounds she's going to divorce me." <br><br>"She won't have to divorce you, you'll die first!" Sister called back to him. <br><br>"Probably why she wants you on these morning jaunts, Bobby. She'll inherit your enormous wealth," Walter added, knowing quite well that Bobby and Betty both worked like dogs at Franklin Printing and weren't amassing any great fortune for it. <br><br>"You notice I only drag my ass out when I know you're going to be here, Doc. If I grab my chest, you'll know what to do." Bobby winked. <br><br>Sister noticed a hound's head come up, drawn by an enticing aroma lifting off the meadows. <br><br>"Nellie, settle," Sister quietly said, and Nellie dispelled her brief notion of making a wild break for the rising fox scent. <br><br>They walked and chatted for another half mile, then returned home by the route they had come. <br><br>At the covered bridge, Shaker noticed Peppermint stretched out by the creekside. Eyes sharp, he turned to face his pack. "Hold up." <br><br>The hounds stopped. <br><br>"What's up?" Betty asked as she pushed a stray lock of blonde hair off her forehead. <br><br>"Walter, go over there and check on Peppermint, will you?" Shaker called back to the physician. <br><br>Walter, a former star halfback at Cornell, put one hand on the top rail of the fence and gracefully vaulted over it. He loped to the unmoving horse, who was being watched over by his two old friends. <br><br>Walter called to Peppermint. No response. When he reached the aged animal he knelt down and felt Peppermint's neck for a pulse. <br><br>"Oh, Pepper, what a good horse you were." He gently patted the dead animal's neck, then rose and recrossed the green meadow back to the waiting group. <br><br>He leaned over the fence and simply said, "Gone." <br><br>Sister lowered her head for several moments as the news sank in. She'd known this horse for more than three decades. As sad as she was, Tedi would be devastated. <br><br>"Shaker, Bobby, take the hounds back to the kennels," she instructed. "Betty and Walter, if you can spare the time, stay with me. We need to bury this fellow before Tedi comes out and finds him. She loved him so." Sister paused. "A last link with Nola." <br><br>"And it is July, he'll blow up fast," Shaker said under his breath. Then he called to the hounds in a singsong voice, "Come along." <br><br>The hounds followed after him, though Cora couldn't help a glance over her shoulder at the horse she remembered well. <br><br>"Walter, do you mind finding one of Tedi's men? Just ask him to meet us at the bridge with the backhoe. Button his lip. I'll tell Tedi once we've properly buried Peppermint." <br><br>Walter jogged across the bridge as Betty and Sister went to the carcass at creek's edge. <br><br>Betty knelt down to touch the large shoulder. "What a great one he was. Godspeed, Peppermint. You had a wonderful life." <br><br>Sister, with Raleigh at her side, consoled Domino and Merry Andrew before sitting down beside Peppermint. "Jesus, Betty, I'm getting old. I remember Pepper when he was steel gray. He's pure white now." She referred to the fact that gray horses, born dark, lighten in color as they age. <br><br>"Remember the time Tedi hit every fence perfectly in the hunter trials? Tedi couldn't find her distance if you gave her measuring tape. But by God, she won the blue ribbon that year. I think it was one of the happiest moments of her life." Betty continued stroking the animal's beautiful gray head. "He did it for her. Pepper didn't much like showing. He liked hunting." Betty smiled, marveling at the capacity of animals to love humans, creatures who so often failed to reciprocate. <br><br>"God, I hope we can pull this off before Tedi finds out. I mean, I hope she's not up there in the barn or gardening or something. If she sees the backhoe rumble out of the equipment shed, she'll be curious." Sister plucked a blade of grass, sucking out the sweetness. "Peppermint was the last horse Nola hunted. Tedi is going to be upset." <br><br>"That's why you sent Walter-in case the news has to be broken now." <br><br>"Yes, I did, didn't I?" Sister grinned, an appealing, girlish grin for a seventy-one-year-old woman, thin as a blade and just as sharp. <br><br>"Poor Tedi, not that I wouldn't cry my eyes out if Outlaw died, mind you." Betty referred to her adored and sturdily built horse. <br><br>"We all would. Even that asshole Crawford Howard would cry if Czapaka died." Crawford was a rich, blowhard member of the Hunt, and his horse, Czapaka, endured him with only occasional moments of justified rebellion. Sister and Betty had known each other for all of Betty's forty-odd years, so Sister spoke with complete candor to her. Had it been anyone but an old friend she would never have openly criticized Crawford. <br><br>"Tedi's such a dear soul," Betty sighed. <br><br>"Strange life." <br><br>"I don't wish inherited wealth on anyone. It's a real curse," Betty declared. "It's one thing to earn a pile of money, it's another to never work for anything at all." <br><br>"I agree. I've known very few people who weren't scalded by it in one way or t'other." She pronounced "another" the old Virginia way.<br><br>"Tedi has surely had her share of suffering." <br><br>"That she has." <br><br>They halted their conversation, rising as a large backhoe chugged over the hill, down the farm road, then rattled through the covered bridge. Walter stood behind the driver, Jimmy Chirios, an industrious, cheerful young man only two years in the Bancrofts' employ. <br><br>Jimmy cut the motor and looked down at Peppermint. "Just like that?" <br><br>"A peaceful death." Sister had to shade her eyes to look up at him in the morning sun. <br><br>Walter hopped off the equipment. "Jimmy, we can't bury him here. The creek floods wicked bad every couple of years. Higher ground." <br><br>Domino and Merry Andrew, having moved away when the backhoe arrived, now returned to stand near their fallen friend. <br><br>"This side of the bridge is anchored on high ground. You wouldn't have to drag him but a hundred yards. Did you bring a chain?" Sister inquired. <br><br>"Yep." Jimmy handed the thick chain to Walter, who looped it around Peppermint's hind legs, then snapped the heavy hook around another loop of chain on the back of the big yellow machine. <br><br>"Slow," Walter ordered as the two women walked up to what they concluded would be the ideal spot above the abutment. <br><br>As Peppermint was dragged to his final resting place, Domino, his bay head bowed, and Merry Andrew, curious as always, followed behind, somewhat obscuring the mark Peppermint's body made. Walter unhitched the chain, then unwrapped it from Peppermint. Jimmy started digging. <br><br>The rise, just above the bridge abutment, was a good place. Rain had softened the earth two days earlier, and the clawed jaw of the backhoe easily bit into it. Jimmy rapidly dug out a seven-foot-deep trench, then squared the sides, forming a tidy rectangle. As they were all country people, they knew that animals could smell decay under the earth. A good six feet or more for a grave was mandatory or, sure enough, whatever was buried would be resurrected by scavengers. And much as one might have missed the deceased, one did not wish the return of a hoof or a leg. <br><br>"Looks good," Walter hollered through hands cupped to his mouth. <br><br>But Jimmy decided the side of the grave closest to the bridge needed more tidying. <br><br>He lowered the jaws into the earth. A crumble of rich alluvial deposit rolled down into the bottom as he swung the captured earth over the side of the grave. <br><br>"Stop!" Sister cried. She astonished them all by leaping into the grave. <br><br>"What the hell are you doing?" Betty said as Walter leaned over the grave. Then he, too, jumped right in. <br><br>At the bottom edge of the freshly dug hole, Walter and Sister stared at the whitened bones of what looked like an elbow. <br><br>"Human?" Sister asked. <br><br>"I think so." Walter carefully brushed away the earth until more bone was revealed. Unable to resist, Betty joined them. Jimmy clambered down from the cab of the backhoe and knelt down at the edge of the gaping hole. <br><br>"I can't believe this," Betty gasped. <br><br>Walter kept brushing. More arm bones. Then a hand. Definitely human. <br><br>The long rays of the morning sun crept into the tomb, causing the royal blue of a huge sapphire flanked by two diamonds to glitter in the light. <br><br>"The Hapsburg sapphire," Betty whispered. <br><br>"Sweet Jesus." Sister's hands shook as she reached to touch the sapphire, then pulled back.</p><h2>Holy Bible Darby Translation</h2><p>John Nelson Darby's translation edition (1890). Both Old and New Testament. <p> Review of Darby Translation and others by Douglas Krause: </p><p> "After comparing for 5+ years the following Interlinear translations of Old &amp; New Testament [Jay P. Green's LITV, Zondervan's Parallel N.T. by Alfred Marshall, Young's Literal Translation (YLT), Analytical-Literal Translation (ALT), Darby's Translation, Morris's Literal Translation] as well as formal translations (ASV, Amplified Bible, NASB, NASB update, NKJV, MKJV) with respect to the Greek and Hebrew, YLT is the best with DARBY'S AS A STRONG 2ND PLACE. Because it follows the Hebrew and Greek Grammar and Syntax the best of all." </p><p> "..the interlinear translations (Young's, Green's, Darby's, McReynold's, Marshall's, Morris') are the most accurate than the formal translations (KJV, NKJV, NASB)...The Formal and Interlinear/Literal translations translate using a "word-for-word" method whereby the translator "translates" only. This prevents him/her from interpreting or inputting any doctrinal bias not found in the Original Word of God (Greek and Hebrew Manuscripts). The Interlinear translation is more accurate than the Formal because it follows the Greek Grammar and Syntax (word order), while the Formal follows more of an English Grammar and Syntax to improve readability, but at the cost of accuracy.

At the young age of twenty-two, he assumed the directorship of the Alabama Voter Registration Project in Selma&#x2015;a city that had previously been removed from the organization's list due to the dangers of operating there. <br><br>In this electrifying memoir, written with Kathryn Lee Johnson, LaFayette shares the inspiring story of his years in Selma. When he arrived in 1963, Selma was a small, quiet, rural town. By 1965, it had made its mark in history and was nationally recognized as a battleground in the fight for racial equality and the site of one of the most important victories for social change in our nation. <br><br>LaFayette was one of the primary organizers of the 1965 Selma voting rights movement and the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, and he relates his experiences of these historic initiatives in close detail. Today, as the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is still questioned, citizens, students, and scholars alike will want to look to this book as a guide. Important, compelling, and powerful, <i>In Peace and Freedom</i> presents a necessary perspective on the civil rights movement in the 1960s from one of its greatest leaders.</p><p><b>Bernard LaFayette Jr.</b> is Distinguished Senior Scholar-in-Residence at the Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Chair of the National Board of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).<br><br><b>Kathryn Lee Johnson</b> teaches in the School of Education at the University of Rhode Island. She has authored several books for educators on teaching, writing, and developing independent study skills."LaFayette, a product of the Nashville Movement, experienced extensive formal training in nonviolent techniques from the instruction of James M. Lawson Jr. Although the Selma Movement has drawn the attention of innumerable scholars, journalists, and participants, none have written about it as a successful experiment in Gandhian nonviolence learned in nonviolent workshops like the ones which Lawson operated. This is the vital and singular contribution that the LaFayette memoir offers to southern civil rights movement literature."&#x2015;Dennis C. Dickerson, author of <i>African American Preachers and Politics: The Careys of Chicago</i><p>"[A] powerful history of struggle, commitment, and hope. No one, but no one, who lived through the creation and development of the movement for voting rights in Selma is better prepared to tell this story than Bernard LaFayette himself."&#x2015;from the foreword by John Robert Lewis, Representative, United States House of Representatives</p><p>"Bernard Lafayette has lived through half a century of nonviolent activism. From Nashville to New York, from sit-ins to Selma. Bernard has been at the center of thought and action that attempts to free the world of violence and hatred. From California and Chicago to Colombia and Nigeria he has braved the threats and intimidation to witness for the power of non-violent action. You must read this book and he must write the next one soon; there are so few of us left who lived to tell the story of how we've overcome."&#x2015;Andrew Young, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, 1977&#x2013;1979</p><p>"In this book by Bernard LaFayette Jr., we see a pattern of successful nonviolent action during the civil rights movement with MLK that became the basis for teaching in countries across the world."&#x2015;C.

LaFayette's new memoir, <i>In Peace and Freedom: My Journey in Selma</i>, offers an eye-opening look inside that pivotal era in American history."&#x2015;<i>Tampa Bay Times</i></p><p>"An inspiring story of the human qualities and sacrifices that helped bring about a world we sometimes take for granted."&#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>"[LaFayette's] memoir details just what it took to get an African American registered to vote in a state where, in some counties, that hadn't happened in more than 50 years. He worked with other brave men and women, overcoming white and black leaders who did not like outsiders, and trained black residents to pass the arduous literacy test. The specter of violence and death hung over them. The project came to a head in 1965 when he, Martin Luther King Jr., and thousands of others marched from Selma to Montgomery, AL, in support of voting rights, and Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. Throughout, LaFayette expounds on the principles of nonviolence and how they helped the movement. This book is for anyone interested in civil rights history, American history, or the philosophy of nonviolence. Recommended."&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"LaFayette provides a fascinating account of his courageous organizing work as, slowly and carefully, he organized the few local black activists willing to participate in a campaign to register black voters.

The alleged murderer has his share of secrets, but Falk smells conspiracy in the air. And although she turns to her mentor, law professor Mackenzie Smith for help, she's got to beat a cunning madman and a nuclear blast....<br>An Alternate Selection of the Literary Guild</p><p><b>Margaret Truman</b> won faithful readers with her works of biography and fiction, particularly her ongoing series of Capital Crimes mysteries. Her novels let us into the corridors of power and privilege, and poverty and pageantry, in the nation&#x2019;s capital. She was the author of many nonfiction books, including <i>The President&#x2019;s House,</i> in which she shares some of the secrets and history of the White House where she once resided. Truman lived in Manhattan and passed away in 2008.1<br> &nbsp;<br> The upper quadrant of a sun that would scorch the desert blossomed on the horizon, livid red and rising fast into an inky sky. Black-browed, graceful bedouin in kaffiyehs and burnooses who had not received the warning&#x2014;or who had chosen to ignore it&#x2014;fed their feisty camels and prepared to serve the Prophet for yet another day.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a bunker dug into the sand, men waited and watched, their attention focused on a steel skeleton six miles away that jutted up into the now-brightening sky. They wore special dark glasses, and powerful field glasses dangled on leather straps from (heir necks. A bank of electronic equipment was in front of them, LEDs fluttering, row upon row of red, green, and yellow lights blinking. A stocky man in a military uniform the color of earth counted down, his concentration on a digital clock that advanced silently&#x2014;and incessantly. Other men aimed video cameras at the skinny metal aberration in the middle of the vast desert.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Minus two,&#x201d; the clock-watcher said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Standby.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Minus one,&#x201d; the keeper of the clock said, precisely one minute later.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cameras.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rolling.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Glasses on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thirty&nbsp;...&nbsp;twenty-nine&nbsp;...&nbsp;twenty-eight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The bunker was pungent with anticipation. And fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Three&nbsp;...&nbsp;two&nbsp;...&nbsp;one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It started slowly, a barely discernible rumbling of the earth. Then a brilliant white light erupted from atop the metal stand, its intensity reaching those in the bunkers slightly ahead of the sound. And in a second, no more than two, the awesome potency of energy equivalent to twenty thousand tons of TNT drove down and up and out&#x2014;sending smoke and fire and acres of the desert itself into the heavens, its courier and its cap a mushroom cloud of devastation.<br> &nbsp;<br> The video cameras captured every perverse second of the sequence&#x2014;from the rumble to the fulgent light to the grimly familiar mushroom. Monitoring stations around the globe registered it on their sensitive meters. The meters and accompanying apparatus told a striking story. The Russians immediately knew the first fact. A weapon with the approximate power of America&#x2019;s first atomic test had been detonated somewhere in the Middle East. Others knew, too. The Danes, the Japanese, the French&nbsp;...&nbsp;and several select groups of Americans, who converged like smaller clouds.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the Hybla Valley Federal Building on Telegraph Road, south of Alexandria, Virginia, members of the Defense Nuclear Agency&#x2019;s Operations Division gathered for an emergency meeting.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the Pentagon the Joint Chiefs of Staff huddled in a closely guarded conference room within the National Military Command Center, across the hall on the E ring&#x2019;s third floor from the offices of the SecDef, the secretary of defense, who, at that moment, was in the White House conferring with his president, David Beardsley, and a dour Cabinet. The hastily drawn report by DOD&#x2019;s nuclear-monitoring section had been read to them in somber, flat tones.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then he&#x2019;s got it,&#x201d; Beardsley said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It appears that way.&#x201d; Secretary of State Warren Smith&#x2019;s face was expressionless.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; said Vice President Joe Fletcher.<br> &nbsp;<br> President Beardsley took in the other faces of his Cabinet. Then, in an uncharacteristic display, he slammed his fist on the table. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got it. That madman has got the bomb.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> 2<br> &nbsp;<br> The desert test that had awakened the world to the renewed potentials of war had occurred in early July. Now, on a hot, sticky day in late August, air-force major Falk sat on one of many benches in the Pentagon&#x2019;s center court, a five-acre magnolia-lined park caught within the building&#x2019;s five walls. The morning sun did to her silken black hair what sunshine always does to such hair&#x2014;brought out its underlying copper tones. She wore khaki Bermuda shorts, pristine white sneakers, and a pink T-shirt with green lettering on its front that said &#x201c;I&#x2019;M A WHIRLYBIRD&nbsp;...&nbsp;AND PROUD OF IT.&#x201d; Margit Falk, named after her German-born mother who&#x2019;d died when Margit was five, was usually called Margaret by those to whom she was introduced, and who did not listen carefully. There was a time when she considered changing her name to the American version, but got through that short period of insecurity and proudly, almost compulsively, spelled out Margit to the confused. Naturally, people were prone to call her Peg, or Peggy, but she unfailingly, and pleasantly, shifted them back to the name she preferred.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was beautiful, no dissenting votes. Hers was the sort of beauty that warmed the winds of romance for certain men and fueled the fires, the sexual fantasies, of adolescent men of any age eagerly awaiting their next copy of Playboy. She was, in living color, what publisher Hugh Hefner had promised would be &#x201c;the girl next door&#x201d; and seldom was, unless you lived next door to a&nbsp;...&nbsp;well, never mind. In fact, a Playboy photographer once had visited Lowry Air Force Base intent upon developing a photo feature about military women. When he spotted Margit, he knew he had his centerfold&#x2014;until, spotting the flash in his eye, she politely told him that once past infancy, she took off her clothes for only a few human beings, most of them doctors or nurses; that her military career meant more than all the money Mr. Hefner had ever possessed or even had lost; and that she found the idea of standing around in the nude rather silly. Besides, she said, her smile an entire sunrise in itself, she had no apple to peddle.<br> &nbsp;<br> No pox on the photographer&#x2019;s artistic judgment, however. Five feet seven inches tall, long-legged and nicely tanned in midyear, naturally melanous in other seasons, Margit Falk was, by strength of character, a more likely candidate for the cover of Prevention. &#x201c;Tight&#x201d; was a word sometimes used to describe her figure. &#x201c;Athletic.&#x201d; &#x201c;Healthy.&#x201d; All those things and more.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes, she was mistakenly assumed to be French. In fact, her paternal grandparents were French, and she&#x2019;d spent much of her youth with them, resulting in a fair working knowledge of the language, at least conversationally. Her father had been a line-maintenance chief in the air force, which made Margit a military brat. She&#x2019;d enjoyed her childhood despite the frequent moves. Her father worked as hard at raising her as he did at ensuring that the aircraft in his charge were safe for their pilots. He&#x2019;d lived long enough to guide her into the early innings of her adult life. She missed him, sometimes painfully.<br> &nbsp;<br> The large eyes were surprisingly blue for someone with such dusky skin tone, unexpectedly bright, direct eyes that exuded, at once, intelligence along with a natural friendliness.<br> &nbsp;<br> She did not dress or walk provocatively, but no matter. Whatever Margit wore&#x2014;a T-shirt that suggested nicely proportioned bosom and distinctly female hips, dress blues, or a pilot&#x2019;s fatigues&#x2014;she turned heads. As she did that morning, swiveling not her hips but the heads of a dozen men who were also there for the Pentagon&#x2019;s T&amp;E annual picnic. Those men from the Office of Test and Evaluation who weren&#x2019;t with wives or girlfriends were the most overt in their admiration. Those with short-term or long-running attachments were more furtive evaluating what they&#x2019;d never test.</p><h2>Call After Midnight</h2><p><p>Thrilling romantic suspense from a best-selling author - A ringing phone in the middle of the night shakes newly-wed Sarah Fontaine awake.

Forstchen continues the story of a Confederate victory, examining the great "what if" of American history: Could Lee have won the Battle of Gettysburg? A Confederate victory, however, would not necessarily mean that the Southern cause has gained its final triumph and a lasting peace. It is from this departure point that the story continues in <i>Grant Comes East</i>, as General Robert E. Lee's marches on Washington, D.C., and launches an assault against one of the largest fortifications in the world.</p><p>Beyond a military victory in the field, Lee must also overcome the defiant stand of President Abraham Lincoln, who vows that regardless of the defeat at Gettysburg, his solemn pledge to preserve the Union will be honored at all cost.</p><p>At the same time, Lincoln has appointed General Ulysses S. Grant as commander of all Union forces. Grant, fresh from his triumph at Vicksburg, races east, bringing with him his hardened veterans from Mississippi to confront Lee.</p><p>What ensues across the next six weeks is a titanic struggle as the surviving Union forces inside the fortifications of Washington fight to hang on, while Grant prepares his counterblow.

As an alternative history of Gettysburg, it stands alone. The mastery of operational history enables the authors to expand the story's scope. The larger-scale, more fluid battle of Gettysburg described is internally consistent, a logical consequence of the novel's challenging major premise.

Using Wilder's stories, personal correspondence, a previously unpublished autobiography, and experiences in South Dakota, Hill has produced a historical-literary biography of the famous and much-loved author. Following the course of Wilder's life, and her real family's journey west, Hill provides a context both familial and literary, for Wilder's writing career. <p><i>Laura Ingalls Wilder: A Writer's Life</i> is the first book in the South Dakota Biography Series, which highlights some of the state's most famous residents. <i>Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane: Deadwood Legends</i> and <i>Seth Bullock: Black Hills Lawman</i> are also a part of this series.

I ve read all of the Bio s about Laura and felt that this one was one of the best. It gave a very clear portrait of the relationship Laura and Rose had while writing the books. It pointed out very clearly that even if Rose had some participation with editing/story development, the stories were Laura s. Smith points out that Rose s experience with writing fiction was limited, that she wrote for magazines and was not generally considered a fiction writer.

He was recognized throughout Europe as one of the great lawyers, Christian humanists, and classical scholars of his day. Despite refusing to endorse Henry VIII&#39;s plan to divorce Katherine, More became Lord Chancellor in 1529. He resigned in 1532 in disapproval of Henry&#39;s stance toward the church. He refused to attend the coronation of Anne Boleyn in June 1533, a matter which did not escape the King&#39;s notice. In April, 1534, More refused to swear to the Act of Succession, and the Oath of Supremacy, and was committed to the Tower of London on April 17. He was found guilty of treason and was beheaded on July 6, 1535. His final words on the scaffold were: &#34;The King&#39;s good servant, but God&#39;s first.&#34; In 1935 Thomas More was canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. In 2000 Pope John Paul II declared him the patron saint of politicians.The Sadness of Christ<br><br>The Sadness, the Weariness, the Fear, and the Prayer of Christ Before He Was Taken Prisoner. Matthew 26, Mark 14, Luke 22, John 18.<br><br>"When Jesus had said these things, they recited the hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives."1<br><br>Though He had spoken at length about holiness during the supper with His apostles, nevertheless He finished His discourses with a hymn when He was ready to leave. Alas, how different we are from Christ, though we call ourselves Christians: our conversation during meals is not only meaningless and inconsequential (and even for such negligence Christ warned us that we will have to render an accounting)2 but often our table talk is also vicious, and then finally, when we are bloated with food and drink, we leave the table without giving thanks to God for the banquets He has bestowed upon us, with never a thought for the gratitude we owe Him.<br><br>[Paul of Saint Mary, Archbishop of] Burgos,3 a learned, holy man, and an outstanding investigator of sacred subjects, gives some convincing arguments to show that the hymn which Christ at that time recited with His apostles consisted of those six psalms which, taken together, are called by the Jews "The Great Alleluia"--namely Psalm 112 and the five following it. For from very ancient times the Jews have followed the custom of reciting these six psalms, under the name "Great Alleluia," as a prayer of thanksgiving at the Passover and certain other principal feasts, and even now they still go through the same hymn on the same feastdays.<br><br>But as for us, though we used to say different hymns of thanksgiving and benediction at meals according to the different times of the year, each hymn suited to its season, we have now permitted almost all of them to fall out of use, and we rest content with saying two or three words, no matter what, before going away, and even those few words we mumble merely for form's sake, muttering through our yawns.<br><br>"They went out to the Mount of Olives," not to bed. The prophet says, "I arose in the middle of the night to pay homage to you,"4 but Christ did not even lie down in bed. But as for us, I wish we could truly apply to ourselves even this text: "I thought of you as I lay in my bed."5<br><br>Moreover, it was not yet summer when Christ left the supper and went over to the mount. For it was not that much beyond the vernal equinox, and that the night was cold is clearly shown by the fact that the servants were warming themselves around charcoal fires in the courtyard of the high priest.6 But this was not the first time that Christ had done this, as the evangelist clearly testifies when he says "as He customarily did."7<br><br>He went up a mountain to pray, teaching us by this sign that, when we prepare ourselves to pray, we must lift up our minds from the bustling confusion of human concerns to the contemplation of heavenly things.<br><br>Mount Olivet itself also has a mysterious significance, planted as it was with olive trees. For the olive branch was generally used as a symbol of peace, which Christ came to establish between God and man after their long alienation. Moreover, the oil which is produced from the olive represents the anointing by the Spirit, for Christ came and then returned to His Father in order to send the Holy Spirit upon the disciples so that His anointing might then teach them what they would not have been able to bear had it been told them only a short time before.8<br><br>"Across the stream Cedron to the outlying estate named Gethsemane."9<br><br>The stream Cedron lies between the city of Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and the word "Cedron" in Hebrew means "sadness." The name "Gethsemane" in Hebrew means "most fertile valley" or "valley of olives." And so there is no reason for us to attribute it merely to chance that the evangelists recorded these place-names so carefully. For if that were the case, once they had reported that He went to the Mount of Olives, they would have considered that they had said quite enough, if it were not that God had veiled under these place-names some mysterious meanings which attentive men, with the help of the Holy Spirit, would try to uncover because the names were mentioned. And so, since not a single syllable can be thought inconsequential in a composition which was dictated by the Holy Spirit as the apostles wrote it, and since not a sparrow falls to the earth without God's direction,10 I cannot think either that the evangelists mentioned those names accidentally or that the Jews assigned them to the places (whatever they themselves intended when they named them) without a secret plan (though unknown to the Jews themselves) of the Holy Spirit, who concealed in these names a store of sacred mysteries to be ferreted out sometime later.<br><br>But since "Cedron" means "sadness," and also "blackness," and since this same word is the name not only of the stream mentioned by the evangelists but also (as is sufficiently established) of the valley through which the stream flows and which separates the city from the estate Gethsemane, these names (if their effect is not blocked by our drowsiness) remind us that while we are exiled from the Lord (as the apostle says)11 we must surely cross over, before we come to the fruitful Mount of Olives and the pleasant estate of Gethsemane, an estate which is not gloomy and ugly to look at but most fertile in every sort of joy, we must (I say) cross over the valley and stream of Cedron, a valley of tears and a stream of sadness whose waves can wash away the blackness and filth of our sins. But if we get so weary of pain and grief that we perversely attempt to change this world, this place of labor and penance, into a joyful haven of rest, if we seek heaven on earth, we cut ourselves off forever from true happiness, and will drown ourselves in penance when it is too late to do any good and in unbearable, unending tribulations as well.<br><br>This, then, is the very salutary lesson contained in these placenames, so fittingly chosen are they. But as the words of holy scripture are not tied to one sense only but rather are teeming with various mysterious meanings, these place-names harmonize with the immediate context of Christ's passion very well, as if for that reason alone God's eternal providence had seen to it that these places should long beforehand have been designated by such names as would prove to be, some centuries later, preordained tokens of His passion, as the comparison of His deeds with the names would show. For, since "Cedron" means "blackened," does it not seem to recall that prediction of the prophet that Christ would work out His glory by means of inglorious torment, that He would be disfigured by dark bruises, gore, spittle, and dirt?--"There is nothing beautiful or handsome about his face."12<br><br>Then, too, the meaning of the stream He crossed--"sad"--was far from irrelevant as He Himself testified when He said, "My soul is sad unto death."13<br><br>"And His disciples also followed Him."14<br><br>That is, the eleven who had remained followed Him. As for the twelfth, the devil entered into him after the morsel and made off with him,15 so that he did not follow the master as a disciple but pursued Him as a traitor, and bore out only too well what Christ said: "He who is not with me is against me."16 Against Christ he certainly was, since, at that very moment, he was preparing to spring his trap for Him, while the other disciples were following after Him to pray. Let us follow after Christ and pray to the Father together with Him. Let us not emulate Judas by departing from Christ, after partaking of His favors and dining excellently with Him, lest we should bear out that prophecy: "If you saw a thief you ran away with him."17<br><br>"Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place, because Jesus frequently went there with His disciples."18<br><br>Once again the evangelists take advantage of mentioning the betrayer to emphasize for us, and to recommend to us by such emphasis, Christ's holy custom of going together with His disciples to that place in order to pray. For if He had gone there only on some nights and not frequently, the betrayer would not have been so completely convinced he would find our Lord there that he could afford to bring the servants of the high priest and a Roman cohort there as if everything had been definitely arranged, for if they had found that it was not arranged, they would have thought he was playing a practical joke on them and would not have let him get away with it unscathed. Now where are those people who think they are men of stature, who are proud of themselves as if they had done something fine, if sometimes, on the vigil of a special feast, they either continue their prayers a little longer into the night or get up earlier for their morning prayers? Our Savior Christ had the habit of spending whole nights without sleep in order to pray.<br><br>Where are those who called Him a glutton for food and wine because He did not refuse to go to the banquets of the publicans and did not think it beneath Him to attend the celebrations of sinful men?19 Where are those who thought that, by comparison with the strict regimen of the pharisees, His morals were hardly better than those of the common rabble? But while these gloomy hypocrites were praying on the corners of the main thoroughfares so that they might be seen by men, He was eating lunch with sinners, calmly and kindly helping them to reform their lives. On the other hand, He used to spend the night praying under the open sky20 while the hypocritical pharisee was snoring away in his soft bed. How I wish that those of us who are prevented by our own laziness from imitating the illustrious example of our Savior might at least be willing to call to mind His all-night vigils when we turn over on the other side in our beds, half asleep, and that we might then, during the short time before we fall asleep again, offer Him thanks, condemn our slothfulness, and pray for an increase of grace. Surely if we set out to make a habit of doing even the least little bit of good, I feel certain that God will soon set us forward a great way on the path of virtue.21<br><br>"And He said, 'Sit down here while I go over there to pray.' And He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him. He began to feel sorrow and grief and fear and weariness. Then He said to them, 'My soul is sad unto death. Stay here and keep watch with me.'"22<br><br>Commanding the other eight to stop somewhat lower down, He went further on, taking with Him Peter, John, and his brother James, the three whom He had always singled out from the rest of the apostles by a certain special privilege of intimacy. Now even if He had done this for no other reason than that He wanted to, no one ought to have been envious because of His generosity.23 But still there were certain reasons for this which He might well have had in mind. For Peter was outstanding for his zealous faith and John for his virginity, and his brother James was to be the very first of all to suffer martyrdom in the name of Christ. Furthermore, these were the three to whom He had formerly granted the secret knowledge and open sight of His glorified body. It was only right, then, that those same three whom He had admitted to such an extraordinary vision and whom He had invigorated with a momentary flash of the eternal brilliance so that they ought to have been stronger than the others, should have assigned to them the role of His nearest supporters in the preliminary agony of His passion. But when He had gone on a little way, He suddenly felt such a sharp and bitter attack of sadness, grief, fear, and weariness that He immediately uttered, even in their presence, those anguished words which gave expression to His overburdened feelings: "My soul is sad unto death."24<br><br>For a huge mass of troubles took possession of the tender and gentle body of our most holy Savior. He knew that His ordeal was now imminent and just about to overtake Him: the treacherous betrayer, the bitter enemies, binding ropes, false accusations, slanders, blows, thorns, nails, the cross, and horrible tortures stretched out over many hours. Over and above these, He was tormented by the thought of His disciples' terror, the loss of the Jews, even the destruction of the very man who so disloyally betrayed Him, and finally the ineffable grief of His beloved mother. The gathered storm of all these evils rushed into His most gentle heart and flooded it like the ocean sweeping through broken dikes.<br><br>Perhaps someone may wonder how it could be that our Savior Christ could feel sadness, sorrow, and grief, since He was truly God, equal to His all-powerful Father. Certainly He could not have felt them if He had been God (as He was) in such a way as not to be man also. But as a matter of fact, since He was no less really a man than He was really God, I see no reason for us to be surprised that, insofar as He was man, He had the ordinary feelings of mankind (though certainly no blameworthy ones)--no more than we would be surprised that, insofar as He was God, He performed stupendous miracles. For if we are surprised that Christ felt fear, weariness, and grief, simply on the grounds that He was God, why should we not also be surprised that He experienced hunger, thirst, and sleep, seeing that He was none the less divine for doing these things? But here, perhaps, you may object, "I am no longer surprised at His capacity for these emotions, but I cannot help being surprised at His desire to experience them. For He taught His disciples not to be afraid of those who can kill the body only and can do nothing beyond that;25 and how can it be fitting that He Himself should now be very much afraid of those same persons, especially since even His body could suffer nothing from them except what He Himself allowed?</p><h2>Universe of Stone: Chartres Cathedral and the Invention of the Gothic AKA Universe of Stone: A Biography of Chartres Cathedral</h2><p><p>Chartres Cathedral, south of Paris, is revered as one of the most beautiful and profound works of art in the Western canon. But what did it mean to those who constructed it in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries&#x2014;and why was it built at such immense height and with such glorious play of light, in the soaring manner we now call Gothic? </p><p>In this eminently fascinating work, author Philip Ball makes sense of the visual and emotional power of Chartres and brilliantly explores how its construction&#x2014;and the creation of other Gothic cathedrals&#x2014;represented a profound and dramatic shift in the way medieval thinkers perceived their relationship with their world. Beautifully illustrated and written, filled with astonishing insight, <em>Universe of Stone</em> embeds the magnificent cathedral in the culture of the twelfth century&#x2014;its schools of philosophy and science, its trades and technologies, its politics and religious debates&#x2014;enabling us to view this ancient architectural marvel with fresh eyes. </p></p><p><p>Philip Ball's book <em>Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color</em> was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award; his <em>Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another</em> won the UK's Aventis Prize. He is a consulting editor for <em>Nature</em> magazine, and he lives in London.</p>In this lively biography of Chartres Cathedral, Ball explores the configuration of cultural and technological factors that enabled Europe to achieve a "liberation from gravity" in the twelfth century, including the rise of scholasticism, Platonic obsessions with light and proportion, and heroic masons who "turned geometry into stone." The accomplishments of Gothic architecture were all the more remarkable given that stonework was virtually forgotten in the West in the centuries after Rome fell. Though much of the history of Chartres Cathedral remains opaque, Ball&#x2019;s account of its construction reveals fascinating details (such as the origins of its blue glass, likely scavenged from Roman or Byzantine sites) and evokes its raison d&#x2019;�tre: in an era when architecture "existed to reveal the deep design of God&#x2019;s creation," Chartres "encoded a set of symbols and relationships that mapped out the universe itself." <br>Copyright �2008<i>Click here to subscribe to The New Yorker</i></p><h2>Silk Poems</h2><p>In conjunction with Tufts University&#x2019;s Silk Lab&#x2019;s cutting-edge research on liquified silk, Jen Bervin wrote a poem composed in a six-character chain that corresponds to the DNA structure of silk; modeled on the way a silkworm applies filament to its cocoon.

Demarest</b>&nbsp;says: "A few years ago my wife and I brought our two-year-old son to an open house at a fire station. Ethan loved the big red fire trucks and I became totally enthralled not only by the trucks, but by the idea of serving my community as a firefighter.<br> <br>"Being a full-time illustrator, I work at home, so I could be on call at any time.

As the title suggests, the text is arranged alphabetically, beginning with "A is for Alarm that rings loud and clear. / B is for Boots stowed in our bunker gear." Though the rhyming verse is less satisfying than the dramatic artwork, the simplicity of the text makes this picture book accessible to kids young enough to be excited about fire engines. The large-scale, deeply colored pictures, ablaze with yellows and orange-reds, show broad scenes, such as two firefighters knocking down a wall and closer views, such as a firefighter's hand using a "kool-tool" to open a door. In three appended pages of notes, he discusses fire fighting and explains some aspects of the text. A colorful, dramatic introduction that future firefighters will adore. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It tends toward an unbiblical and unchristian form of Christian witness and does not have the ability to attest truthfully to Christ in our postmodern context. In fact, Christians need an entirely new way of conceiving the apologetic task.<br><br>This provocative text critiques modern apologetic efforts and offers a concept of faithful Christian witness that is characterized by love and grounded in God's revelation. Penner seeks to reorient the discussion of Christian belief, change a well-entrenched vocabulary that no longer works, and contextualize the enterprise of apologetics for a postmodern generation.</p><p><b>"A fresh perspective on the nature of Christian witness"<br></b><br>"This book is quite accessible and passionately committed to Jesus Christ and his work in our world. Penner shows us that the modern age is ending and that the apologetics attached to that age cannot sustain lives of discipleship and witness to the gospel. But the real work of this book is to show us the way forward in faithfulness with a passion that makes us alive in Christ and fully present in the world for its redemption. This is an edifying work that builds us up in the hope and love of the gospel."<br>--<b>Jonathan R. Wilson</b>, Carey Theological College, Vancouver<br><br>"Speaking as a Roman Catholic and something of a Thomist, I welcome Dr. Penner's meticulous and persuasive exposure of the kind of rationalistic apologetics that unwittingly make Christian faith quite unbelievable. A pleasure to read!"<br>--<b>Fergus Kerr</b>, University of Edinburgh<br><br>"In this book Myron Penner challenges many of the intuitions and assumptions that have shaped traditional Christian thought and invites us to rethink them for the sake of the gospel. In doing so he offers a fresh perspective on the nature of Christian witness that has the potential to spark a revitalization of the church and its proclamation of the good news revealed in Jesus Christ."<br>--<b>John R. Franke</b>, Yellowstone Theological Institute, Bozeman, Montana<br><br>"Penner's devastating critique of what passes for the 'defense' of Christianity in the evangelical worldview in today's increasingly hostile intellectual environment should be a rousing wake-up call for all seminary professors and students as well as pastors. Penner dissects the obsolescence, morbidity, and structural dysfunctionality of standard evangelical models of apologetics like a skilled forensic analyst.

Faster-than-light travel was perfected, and the Eschaton, a superhuman artificial intelligence, was born. Four hundred years later, the far-flung colonies that arose as a result of these events&#x2014;scattered over three thousand years of time and a thousand parsecs of space&#x2014;are beginning to rediscover their origins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The New Republic is one such colony. It has existed for centuries in self-imposed isolation, rejecting all but the most basic technology.

Spaceship engineer Martin Springfield and U.N. diplomat Rachel Mansour hail from an Earth that has gone through the Singularity, an accelerated technological and social evolution far beyond anything we can imagine. The Singularity was triggered by the Eschaton, a super-powerful being descended from humanity that can travel in time and that essentially rules the universe. Springfield and Mansour meet on the home world of the New Republic, a repressive, backwater society that has outlawed virtually all advanced technology other than that necessary for interstellar warfare. When one of the New Republic's colonial worlds is besieged by the Festival, an enigmatic alien intelligence, the Republic counterattacks, using time travel in an attempt to put its warships in position to catch the Festival by surprise. Springfield and Mansour, working for different masters, have both been assigned the task of either diffusing the crisis or sabotaging the New Republic's warfleet, no matter what the cost. As a newcomer to long fiction, Stross has some problems with pacing, but the book still generates plenty of excitement.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bad Boyfriends: Using Attachment Theory to Avoid Mr. (or Ms.) Wrong and Make You a Better Partner</h2><p>This book is a practical guide to using the science of attachment and relationships to find the right life partner. If you were brought up in the Western world, you&#x2019;ve been trained on fairy tales of love and relationships that are misleading at best, and at worst have you making mistake after mistake in starting relationships with the wrong kinds of people who will waste your time and keep you from finding a loyal partner. Science has the answer! Or at least a guide to save you the time and effort of discovering for yourself how many wrong types of romantic partners there are. Reading this book will help you recognize the signs of some of the syndromes that prevent people from being good partners. We&#x2019;ll go through those syndromes and point out some of the signs. Those little red flags you sometimes notice when you are getting to know someone? Often they speak loud and clear once you understand the types, and you can decide immediately to run away or approach with caution those who show them. If you&#x2019;re young and just starting to look for a partner, good news&#x2014;the world is swarming with well-adjusted, charming matches for you, if you know how to recognize them. The bad news: you are inexperienced and you may not recognize the right type of person when you date them. Many people expect to experience an immediate sense of excitement, an overwhelming rush of attraction, and to fall in love rapidly and equally with someone who feels the same. This rarely happens, and when it does it usually ends badly! And expecting it will cause you to let go of people who are steady, loving, and attentive, if you had given them a chance. So once you&#x2019;ve identified someone who makes you laugh, answers your messages, and is there for you when you want them, don&#x2019;t make the mistake of tossing them aside for the merely good-looking, sexy, or intriguing stranger. If you&#x2019;re older, bad news: while you were spending time and effort on relationships you were hoping would turn out better, or even happily nestled in a good relationship or two, most of the secure, reliable, sane people in your age group got paired off. They&#x2019;re married or happily enfamilied, and most of the people your age in the dating pool are tragically unable to form a good long-term relationship. You should always ask yourself, &#x201c;why is this one still available?&#x201d;&#x2014;there may be a good answer (recently widowed or left a long-term relationship), or it may be that this person has just been extraordinarily unlucky in having over twenty short relationships in twenty years (to cite one case!) But it&#x2019;s far more likely you have met someone with a problematic attachment style. As you age past 40, the percentage of the dating pool that is able to form a secure, stable relationship drops to less than 30%[1]; and since it can take months of dating to understand why Mr. or Ms. SeemsNice is really the future ex-partner from Hell, being able to recognize the difficult types will help you recognize them faster and move on to the next. This book outlines the basics (which might be all you need), and points you toward more resources if you want to understand more about your problem partner. If you're wondering if the guy or girl you've been hanging out with might not be quite right, this is the place to match those little red flags you've noticed with known bad types. And by getting out fast, you can avoid emotional damage and wasted time, and get going on finding someone who's really right for you. Study all of the bad types and you'll detect them before even getting involved. Or you could be one of the few people who recognizes their own problems in one of these types. There are study materials and plans of action for you, too. If you've had lots of relationships and they all seem to go wrong, the common factor is you! Your task is to make yourself into a better partner - a goal that even the most evolved of us can always work toward.</p><p>Human loneliness is one of the hidden problems of our technologically advanced and mobile age--as our lives get more complicated and our neighborhood of friends has expanded to include social networks, the loss of community feeling to busy-ness and isolated lives is acutely felt. In this detached world, a good partner, companion, or spouse is more important than ever.<br> <br> Most people are unaware of modern Attachment Theory, developed starting in the 1940s by psychoanalyst John Bowlby observing the homeless and orphaned children of World War II, further developed in children by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1970s, and extended to adults by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver in the late 1980s. While there have been some efforts to explain the theory to the lay audience who could surely apply it usefully in their lives, it remains obscure.&nbsp;<br> <br> This book was written to explain attachment theory (and its application to relationships) to those searching for loyal and trustworthy companions in life. Far too many friends and neighbors have floundered with relationship issues that sap them of energy and make them unhappy. Not every such problem can be solved, but knowing what the landscape of attachment looks like can guide one to a better way of communicating, and a better way of living.Jeb Kinnison grew up in the Midwest, son of a schizophrenic father and a hardworking single mother.

This book is compiled from transcripts of nine of these interviews. While the content is similar to Campbell and Moyers's The Power of Myth (Doubleday, 1988), Toms takes a more conversational approach than did Moyers, making the text easier for the general reader. As a result, this is a good book to recommend to younger readers who might find The Power of Myth too erudite, though unfortunately, it has no illustrations. For any library where there is demand for materials by and about Campbell.

Given the fury in her system, she couldn&#x2019;t believe he&#x2019;d dare point out the obvious to her. She&#x2019;d been known to verbally let serious blood when only half this riled. Truly, the man had no sense of self-preservation. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t have a gun--looks like I&#x2019;m shit out of luck all the way around, huh?&#x201d;Still, he was his ever present calm self--which didn&#x2019;t really help her mood. For once, couldn&#x2019;t he get ticked off, too? &#x201c;I take it you didn&#x2019;t get the permits... again.&#x201d;She could have done without that &#x201c;again&#x201d; part. Really. &#x201c;What was your first clue?&#x201d;&#x201d;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know. That stomping stance as you walked down the street, clenching and unclenching your fists like you&#x2019;re already choking someone, or maybe it&#x2019;s that way you&#x2019;re looking at me like you could claw out my eyes when I haven&#x2019;t done anything to piss you off.&#x201d;&#x201d;Yes, you have.&#x201d;She could tell he was fighting a smile. Thank goodness he had the good sense to keep it hidden. &#x201c;And that is?&#x201d;&#x201d;You don&#x2019;t have a gun.&#x201d;He snorted. &#x201c;Come on now, you can&#x2019;t shoot every Greek official who gets in your way.&#x201d;&#x201d;Wanna bet?&#x201d;Brian stepped back to let her enter the taxi first. At six three, he was a good-looking man in his mid-forties. Very distinguished and intelligent. Best of all, he was independently wealthy and more than capable of financing their latest venture in futility without complaining too much.Unfortunately, he wasn&#x2019;t into bribing public officials.Was it too much to ask that she find a corrupt financier? Surely Brian should have some vice, and at the moment she couldn&#x2019;t think of a more self-serving one than that.&#x201d;So what do we do now?&#x201d; he asked as he joined her in the car.Geary sighed, wishing she had an answer. Her team was waiting on her boat at the docks, but without the permits that allowed them to excavate the mounds she and Tory believed to be a city wall, all they could do was dive over the surface of what they&#x2019;d found and do nothing more than admire it.Sad comfort that. It&#x2019;d been the best lead they&#x2019;d had in years. &#x201c;I want another silt sample.&#x201d;&#x201d;You&#x2019;ve already tested and retested those.&#x201d;&#x201d;I know, but maybe it will help to convince them to give us the permits.&#x201d; Yeah, right. She&#x2019;d been given the run-around particularly good and the words from her latest visit still rang in her ears.&#x201d;This is Greece, Dr. Kafieri. There are ruins all around us and I will not allow you to begin tearing up the floor of the Aegean, which is a busy shipping area, when all you can give me is another this-is-Atlantis story. Really. I&#x2019;ve enough treasure hunters trying to pilfer our national history for their own gain. I don&#x2019;t need any more. We here in Greece take our history most seriously and you&#x2019;re wasting my valuable time. Good day.&#x201d;It was enough to make her want to bang her head on the man&#x2019;s desk until he either relented or had her committed. This wasn&#x2019;t about treasure, but trying to tell that to him had been as futile as trying to fly with wax wings.&#x201d;There has to be some way around this.&#x201d;Brian stiffened. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be a part of anything illegal.&#x201d;And unfortunately, neither would she. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Brian. I don&#x2019;t want to go to jail for this, either.&#x201d;But there had to be something else she could do.... If only the pain in her head would let up enough so that she could think. But the throbbing pain, much like the official, seemed determined to ruin her day.She leaned back in the seat and watched the beautiful buildings and landscape of the town drift by while people went about their business on the sidewalks. How she wished she could be carefree enough to roam in and out of the stores, shopping and laughing like the majority of them. Unfortunately, she&#x2019;d never once been a tourist anywhere.Geary Kafieri was always all work and no play.Neither of them spoke as the taxi wended its way through the narrow streets to the dock where their research boat was waiting. While Brian paid the fare, Geary got out and made her way up the gangway to face their team with her gloriously redundant failure.Tory met her first. At fifteen and very average in height, Geary&#x2019;s cousin had long drab brown hair and thick glasses. She was an awkward teen who had more interest in her books than much of anything else. Even though Tory didn&#x2019;t remember her father, Theron, she was just like him. Finding Atlantis was her only ambition.&#x201d;Well?&#x201d; she asked, her young face expectant.Geary shook her head.Tory let out an expletive that made Geary gape. &#x201c;How could they not let us excavate? What&#x2019;s wrong with those people?&#x201d;&#x201d;They think it&#x2019;s a waste of time.&#x201d;Tory screwed up her face in distaste. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s stupid! They&#x2019;re stupid!&#x201d;&#x201d;Yes,&#x201c; Geary said drily. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re all stupid.&#x201d;Tory scoffed at that. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not stupid. I&#x2019;m a certified genius. But the rest... Stupid.&#x201d;&#x201d;I told you not to bother.&#x201d;Geary looked past Tory&#x2019;s shoulder to find her other cousin, Cynthia, joining them. Named for the Greek goddess of the hunt, Artemis, Thia hated everything to do with Greece. The only reason she was here was to get college credit and follow her latest fixation, Scott, who&#x2019;d thought this would be a fun summer activity. Not to mention the small fact that had Thia stayed at home in New York, she&#x2019;d have been forced to work in her mother&#x2019;s deli, which she hated even more than Greece.At a cool six two, the titian-haired beauty was also one of the few women taller than Geary--something that was quite a feat given the fact that Thia was barely eighteen.Geary frowned as she noted Thia&#x2019;s long blue skirt and white long-sleeved embroidered Grecian blouse. &#x201c;I thought you were sunbathing,&#x201c; Geary said.Tory leaned forward to whisper in her ear. &#x201c;She was, and she took her top off earlier, hoping Scott would see her bare boobs and join her. He didn&#x2019;t, but the men on a passing boat almost fell overboard before Justina made her go belowdecks.&#x201d;Thia curled her lip. &#x201c;You little nark. While you&#x2019;re confessing things, you should tell Geary how you almost set fire to her reports because her cat scared you and you knocked over Teddy&#x2019;s Bunsen burner.&#x201d;Tory blushed before she pushed her glasses up on her nose. &#x201c;Genius, but not graceful. C&#x2019;est moi.&#x201d;Geary smiled at the girl as Tory spoke the terrible truth. Grace had never been Tory&#x2019;s virtue, unlike Thia, who had more than her fair share. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Tor. I&#x2019;d have just made you redo them.&#x201d;Thia gave a heavy sigh as she cast her gaze around the deck. &#x201c;Is this not the most boring place on earth? I can&#x2019;t even get Scott to come up from below for more than a split second.&#x201d;Obviously. If nudity didn&#x2019;t inspire the man to come up, nothing else would.&#x201d;He&#x2019;s down there with Teddy,&#x201c; Thia continued in an irritated tone, &#x201c;draped over an excavation map--like that&#x2019;s ever going to happen. What is it about this godforsaken country that every time I bring a guy here he loses his mind?&#x201d;&#x201d;Maybe it&#x2019;s from being around you too long,&#x201c; Tory said, tucking a stray piece of hair behind her ear. She leaned forward to whisper to Geary in their own unique language of ancient Greek and Latin. &#x201c;I think she sucks the testosterone right out of them and then digests it for her own.&#x201d;Geary laughed.Thia went instantly stiff. &#x201c;What did she say about me?&#x201d;Geary shook her head at Tory before she responded. &#x201c;Why does it always have to be about you, Thia?&#x201d;&#x201d;Because it is.&#x201d; And with that, she flounced off.Tory let out a tired breath. &#x201c;One day I hope she finds someone who can put her in her place. I&#x2019;m tired of watching her emasculate poor Scott. I swear she has to be part succubus.&#x201d;&#x201d;Oh, don&#x2019;t go there. I wouldn&#x2019;t wish her on anyone.&#x201d;&#x201d;Good point.&#x201d; Tory paused before she turned a probing stare on Geary. &#x201c;So tell me what happened.&#x201d;As if she wanted to relive that misery. &#x201c;Not much to say. They refused to give us permits... again.&#x201d;Tory actually stomped her foot. &#x201c;Ah, man. That&#x2019;s so not fair.&#x201d;&#x201d;I know,&#x201c; she said, patting Tory&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;We just have to be patient.&#x201d;&#x201d;To heck with patience. At the rate they&#x2019;re going, I&#x2019;ll be in retirement and will have to dig with a cane.&#x201d; She let out a sound of supreme disgust. &#x201c;This is the closest we&#x2019;ve ever been to finding the city. I know Atlantis is right there. I can feel it!&#x201d;A chill went down Geary&#x2019;s spine. Tory was just a little too close to their fathers in personality for her tastes. The same insanity that had possessed them drove Tory, too. It was like a madness in her blood that kept her working late into the night after everyone else had retired.There were times when it truly scared Geary. All of the people in their family who&#x2019;d ever shared Tory&#x2019;s level of dedication had met with an early death. It would destroy not only Geary but also their grandfather should anything ever happen to their youngest family member.She was what they lived for.Then again, Geary had often suspected that Tory used it as a way to distract herself from the pain she felt at being an orphan. The poor thing had no memory of either of her parents. Their work was the only way Tory could feel close to them...</p></p><h2>The Cross: History, Art, and Controversy</h2><p><p>The cross stirs intense feelings among Christians as well as non-Christians. Robin Jensen takes readers on an intellectual and spiritual journey through the two-thousand-year evolution of the cross as an idea and an artifact, illuminating the controversies&#x2015;along with the forms of devotion&#x2015;this central symbol of Christianity inspires.</p><p>Jesus&#x2019;s death on the cross posed a dilemma for Saint Paul and the early Church fathers. Crucifixion was a humiliating form of execution reserved for slaves and criminals. How could their messiah and savior have been subjected to such an ignominious death? Wrestling with this paradox, they reimagined the cross as a triumphant expression of Christ&#x2019;s sacrificial love and miraculous resurrection. Over time, the symbol&#x2019;s transformation raised myriad doctrinal questions, particularly about the crucifix&#x2015;the cross with the figure of Christ&#x2015;and whether it should emphasize Jesus&#x2019;s suffering or his glorification. How should Jesus&#x2019;s body be depicted: alive or dead, naked or dressed? Should it be shown at all?</p><p>Jensen&#x2019;s wide-ranging study focuses on the cross in painting and literature, the quest for the &#x201c;true cross&#x201d; in Jerusalem, and the symbol&#x2019;s role in conflicts from the Crusades to wars of colonial conquest. <i>The Cross </i>also reveals how Jews and Muslims viewed the most sacred of all Christian emblems and explains its role in public life in the West today.</p></p><p>Robin M. Jensen is Patrick O&#x2019;Brien Professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame.&#x201c;In Robin Jensen&#x2019;s powerful, wide-ranging presentation, the central image of Christianity turns out to be an image of almost unimaginable complexity: a cosmic abstraction, a grim portrait of cruel suffering, a gem-studded token of triumphant authority, an idol to be smashed, a relic to be kissed, a charm to emboss on a Crusader&#x2019;s shield, a tree of life, a paradoxical mystery. Jensen has searched out a vast and beautifully chosen variety of crosses, from Golgotha to Ground Zero, along with songs, poems, and long-lost rituals, to bring us a moving study of faith, both Christian and non-Christian, in its infinite variety.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ingrid D.

What becomes apparent is that there are no clearly defined epochs or entirely different styles of depicting the cross and the Crucifixion...[A] rich and rewarding book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher Irvine</b><b>, </b><b><i>History Today</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Jensen has produced a fantastic historical study of the cross.

It is a quest for understanding the role and purpose of the cross in religious and public life...The book also includes many beautiful color images, adding to its magnificence. This excellent book will undoubtedly become a classic.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J. L.

Imagine how the Hebrews felt during their years of captivity in Babylon. How could they sing the songs they once sang in the spender of Jerusalem now that they sat in exile? Christian worship in the West faces many of the same challenges as this tragic account of Israel&#x2019;s captivity. By all accounts Christendom is dead, and unbiblical beliefs have progressively permeated Western thought, expectations, and culture.<br> So how should churches respond to this seismic shift in their relationship with an increasingly post-Christian culture while still following the biblical mandate to reach that culture with the gospel of Jesus Christ? <i>By the Waters of Babylon</i> will help Christians wrestle through this critical issue of the relationship between Christian worship and evangelistic witness, especially in the context of an increasingly hostile culture. The author demonstrates that biblically regulated, gospel-shaped corporate worship that communicates God&#x2019;s truth through appropriate cultural forms will have the most missional impact in a post-Christian context.</p><p>Scott Aniol, PhD, is assistant professor of ministry and worship at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.

She did not limit herself to the genres considered &#x201c;acceptable&#x201d; for those few women who dared to publish in the late seventeenth century; instead, she wrote philosophical and scientific works, a utopian romance that has often been called the first work of science fiction in English, a biography of her husband, and her own autobiography. She also published two collections of dramatic works: the first of these, Plays, appeared in 1662, the second, Plays, Never before Printed, in 1668. Cavendish was keenly aware that her comedies and tragedies were unlikely to be acted, at least in her lifetime, but that did not deter her. &#x201c;To those that do delight in scenes and wit / I dedicate my book,&#x201d; she writes in a brief poem at the beginning of Plays. She continues, &#x201c;For all the time my plays a-making were, / My brain the stage, my thoughts were acting there.&#x201d; Today the most widely read of Cavendish&#x2019;s plays is The Convent of Pleasure, from Plays, Never before Printed. In this provocative comedy, Cavendish presents us with the delightful Lady Happy, whose determined efforts to avoid the pains of men and marriage lead her to construct a convent where women can devote themselves to enjoying life&#x2019;s pleasures. The women who retreat with her into the Convent of Pleasure are determined to avoid not only the dangers of men and marriage but also of childbirth and motherhood. Even so, they will not deny themselves the pleasures of love. Inside her convent, Lady Happy dares to imagine a radical alternative to marriage: since men and marriage cause only pain and suffering, perhaps a woman can fulfill her emotional and sexual desires with another woman. When she finds her soul&#x2019;s mate in a princess (rather than a prince), Lady Happy poses a critical question to herself and to us: &#x201c;But why may not I love a woman with the same affection I could a man?&#x201d; This Saltar&#x2019;s Point Press edition, designed for classroom use, provides readers with an ample introduction to Cavendish&#x2019;s life and work, a carefully modernized and well-presented text, helpful glosses and notes, a bibliography with references for further reading, and a chronology of Cavendish&#x2019;s published work.</p><p>Sharon L.

Until a few years ago these catfishes played only an insignificant role in our aquaria, but nowadays they have become the height of fashion.<br> Since the latter part of 1988, when a number of new and sometimes exceptionally colorful loricariidae catfish species were first imported, a real catfish boom has sprung into life. Around 500 species new to the aquarium hobby have been imported, and these sometimes vary quite significantly in their requirements. The object of this book is to provide both beginner and more experienced aquarist with an introduction to not only the maintenance but also the breeding of these fishes. It covers some 390 of the most important and most interesting L-number catfishes, listed alphabetically by genus and species, and illustrated in full color. The book uses easily understood symbols to provide details of eventual size and maintenance for each species, and is illustrated with more than 640 color photos, 208 pages, hardcover.<p> Genus descriptions: 38 different genera are described according to the following criteria number of described species, characters, sexual dimorphism, distribution, diet, maintenance in the aquarium.</p><p> Species descriptions: App. 390 species (nearly all that are available in the trade) + photos on color varieties. Each species is described with photo/photos, scientific name, L-number, difficulty to maintain, maximum total length, minimum length of the aquarium, diet, suitable temperature, suitable pH, current water necessary or not, demand of wood etc...</p><p> Chapters:<br> What are L-number catfishes?<br> What should I bear in mind when buying loricariidae catfishes?<br> How can I tell the sexes apart? What is the natural habitat of these fishes like?<br> How are these fishes collected and how do they reach us?<br> What points are important for maintenance in the aquarium?<br> How can I feed these catfishes correctly?<br> What are the commonest diseases of L-number catfishes?<br> How do L-number catfishes breed in their natural habitat?<br> How can I breed these catfishes in the aquarium?<br> What will I require for the rearing of loricariidae catfishes?<br></p></p><p>Ingo Seidel has been working intensively with the armored catfish family (Loricariidae) for more than 20 years. During this time he has maintained countless species in his aquaria and has often bred them as well. He has undertaken numerous expeditions to various South American countries to study the natural ecology of these catfishes and has also garnered copious new information on their requirements. He has made every effort to pass on his extensive knowledge of loricariidae catfishes in numerous lectures and articles, as well as in books like this one.</p><h2>Spanking for Lovers</h2><p>Consensual adult spanking can be sexy or strict, giggly or grave, gentle enough to pinken the skin or intense enough to leave marks.

The symbolism of numbers was both widespread and profoundly ingrained in the culture. In this classic study, a noted scholar reveals &#x201c;how deeply rooted in medieval thought was the consciousness of numbers, not as mathematical tools, nor yet as the counters in a game, but as fundamental realities, alive with memories and eloquent with meaning.&#x201d;<br>For example, the number&nbsp;three &#x2014; linked to the Trinity &#x2014; was of special significance, and &#x201c;endowed every repetition of the number&nbsp;three with a richness of meaning which can be but dimly grasped by the modern reader.&#x201d; Numbers derived from constellations, planets, stellar revolutions, and other astronomical phenomena were also thought to have divine associations. These and many other aspects of the topic are illuminated here. In the first three chapters, the author examines the three main sources of number symbolism; basic, elementary symbols derived from man&#x2019;s struggles to count and identify such natural groupings as fingers and toes; the ancient Babylonian science of astrology; and Pythagorean number theory, which fixed the relationship of the numbers to one another. The fourth and fifth chapters deal with the Gnostics&#x2019; elaborate combination of these elements, and the adoption and elaboration of number philosophy by the early Church Fathers. The last two sections examine medieval number philosophy and Dante&#x2019;s use of number symbolism, particularly in <i>The Divine Comedy.<br></i>Of special interest to medievalists, numerologists, and students of literature, this volume will also fascinate anyone interested in symbology or cultural aspects of the Middle Ages.</p><p></p><h2>The Wind in His Heart</h2><p>De Lint's first adult fantasy novel in 8 years weaves a rich tapestry of story with classic CdL elegance.

They squatted in the little garden squares while they ate their sandwiches, queued at coffee shops and paced the pavements staring at the screens of their smartphones, not realising that she was preparing to call down lightning and spit brimstone.<br><br>On the surface the witch was one of them, but that was just a disguise. She had the power to change her outward appearance, to look like anyone she was standing near.<br><br>Lucy said, &#x2018;She won&#x2019;t be somebody posh. Witches are always poor.&#x2019;<br><br>Tom said, &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t tell who&#x2019;s posh. Everyone looks the same.&#x2019;<br><br>He was right; to a child they did. Grey suits, black suits, white shirts, black skirts, blue ties, print blouses, black shoes. London&#x2019;s workforce on the move.<br><br>Lucy pulled at her favourite yellow T-�shirt and felt her tummy rumble. &#x2018;She&#x2019;ll have to appear soon. They often travel in threes. When a witch starts to get hungry, she loses concentration and lets go of her disguise. The spell will weaken and she&#x2019;ll turn back into her real self.&#x2019;<br><br>She was crouching in the bushes, and wanted to stand up because it was making her legs hurt, but knew she might get caught if she did. The flowerbeds bristled with tropical plants that had spiny razor-�sharp leaves and looked as if they should be somewhere else. A private security guard patrolled the square, shifting the people who looked as if they belonged somewhere else, too.<br><br>&#x2018;What does she really look like?&#x2019; asked Tom. &#x2018;I mean, when she drops her disguise?&#x2019;<br><br>Lucy answered without hesitation. &#x2018;She has a green face and a hooked nose covered in hairy warts, and long brown teeth and yellow eyes. And her breath smells of rotting sardines.&#x2019; She thought for a moment. &#x2018;And toilets.&#x2019;<br><br>Tom snorted in disgust as he looked around the courtyard for likely suspects. Nearby, an overweight woman in her mid- �thirties was standing in a doorway eating a Pret A Manger cray- fish and rocket sandwich. She seemed a likely candidate. The first of the summer&#x2019;s wasps were hovering around, scenting the remains of office lunches. The woman anxiously batted one away as she ate.<br><br>&#x2018;It can&#x2019;t be her,&#x2019; said Lucy.<br><br>&#x2018;Why not?&#x2019; asked Tom.<br><br>&#x2018;Witches don&#x2019;t feel pain, so she wouldn&#x2019;t be scared of a stupid wasp.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Can a witch be a man?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No, that would be a warlock. It has to be a woman.&#x2019;<br><br>Tom was getting tired of the game. Lucy seemed to be making up extra rules as she went along. The June sun shone through a gap in the buildings and burned the back of his neck. The sky above Salisbury Court was as blue as the sea looked in old films.<br><br>He was starting to think that this was a stupid way to spend a Saturday morning when he could have been at soccer. He had been looking forward to seeing the Dr Who exhibition as well, but right at the last minute his dad had to work instead, and said, &#x2018;You can come with me to the office,&#x2019; as if it was a reasonable substitute. There was nothing to do in the office. You weren&#x2019;t allowed to touch the computers or open any of the drawers. His dad seemed to like being there. He always cheered up when he had to go into the office on a Saturday.<br><br>The only other father who had brought his child in that morning was Lucy&#x2019;s, so he was stuck playing with a girl until both of their fathers had finished their work. At least Lucy knew about the game, which was unusual because most girls didn&#x2019;t play games like that. She explained that she had two older brothers and always ended up joining in with them. She didn&#x2019;t tell him they had outgrown the game now and spent their days wired into hip-�hop and dodgy downloads.<br><br>&#x2018;How about that one?&#x2019; said Lucy, taking the initiative. Her brothers could never make up their minds about anything, and always ended up arguing, so she was used to making all the decisions.<br><br>&#x2018;Nah, she&#x2019;s too pretty,&#x2019; said Tom, watching a slender girl in a very short grey skirt stride past to the building at the end of the courtyard.<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s the point. The prettier they look on the outside, the uglier they are inside. Too late, she&#x2019;s gone.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m bored now.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Five more minutes. She&#x2019;s here somewhere.&#x2019; There were only a few workers left in the square, plus a motorcycle courier who must have been stifling in his helmet and leathers.<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s this one. I have a feeling. I bet she belongs to a coven, that&#x2019;s a club for witches. Remember, we have to get them before they get us. Let&#x2019;s check her out. Come on.&#x2019;<br><br>Lucy led the way past a sad-�looking young woman who had just seated herself on the bench nearest the church. She had opened a paperback and was reading it intently. Lucy turned to Tom with an air of theatrical nonchalance and pointed behind the flat of her palm.<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s definitely her.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;How can we tell if she&#x2019;s a witch?&#x2019; Tom whispered.<br><br>&#x2018;Look for signs. Try to see what she&#x2019;s reading.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t walk past her again, she&#x2019;ll see.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Wait, I&#x2019;ve got an idea.&#x2019; Tom had stolen a tennis ball from his father&#x2019;s office. Now he produced it from his pocket. &#x2018;Catch, then throw it back to me in her direction. I&#x2019;ll miss and I&#x2019;ll have to go and get it.&#x2019;<br><br>Lucy was a terrible actress. If the sad-�faced young woman had looked up, she would have stopped and stared at the little girl gurning and grimacing before her.<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m throwing now,&#x2019; Lucy said loudly, hurling the ball ten feet wide of the boy. Tom scrambled in slow motion around the bench, and the young woman briefly raised her eyes.<br><br>Tom ran back to Lucy&#x2019;s side. &#x2018;She&#x2019;s reading a book about babies.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What was it called?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Rosemary&#x2019;s Baby. By a woman called Ira something.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Then she&#x2019;s definitely a witch.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;How do you know?&#x2019;<br><br>Lucy blew a raspberry of impatience. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you know anything? Witches eat babies! Everyone knows that.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;So she really is one,&#x2019; Tom marvelled. &#x2018;She looks so normal.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yeah, clever, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; Lucy agreed. &#x2018;So, how are we going to kill her?&#x2019;</p><h2>My Life as a Joke (The My Life series, 4)</h2><p><p>Derek Fallon discovers all the angst that comes with being twelve&#x2015;he just wants to feel grown up, but life gets in the way with a series of mishaps that make him look like a baby.

Why isn't being in middle school as great as Derek imagined? Thankfully, with a little help from his friends&#x2015;and, ironically, a Toys for Tots fundraiser&#x2015;things seem like they could start shaping up at last.</p><p><b><i>My Life as a Joke </i>by Janet and Jake Tashjian is a Christy Ottaviano Book</b></p></p><p><p><b>Janet Tashjian</b> is the author of the popular My Life series including <i>My Life as a Stuntboy</i>, <i>My Life as a Book</i>, and <i>My Life as a Cartoonist</i>, illustrated by her son, <b>Jake Tashjian</b>; as well as <i>The Gospel According to Larry</i> and <i>For What It's Worth</i>. She lives with her family in Los Angeles, California.</p><i>A Time to Celebrate</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;This is going to be a great year&#x2014;I can feel it!&#x201d; I watch the hands of the clock as they inch toward midnight. <br>Yesterday we stocked up on goodies: pepperoni pizza, strawberries and whipped cream, pistachios, coconut ice cream, double chocolate chip cookies, and celery. (I know that celery doesn&#x2019;t sound like much of a treat, but I like to take giant crunchy bites, let the stalk hang out of my mouth, and pretend I&#x2019;m a newspaper editor in an old-fashioned movie smoking a cigar and barking out orders to a roomful of reporters. Don&#x2019;t ask.) <br>My mother wears a checkered blue dress she got on sale in the Beverly Center. She tells Dad and me how the dress was marked down four times&#x2014;which is unfortunately the number of times she tells the story now. The silver earrings Dad gave her for Christmas dangle from her ears, and she wears pointy high-heel shoes; it&#x2019;s strange to see her in anything besides the comfortable flats she wears in her veterinary practice most days. <br>My dad excuses himself to run upstairs and change his shirt. He says it&#x2019;s because he&#x2019;s chilly but I think it&#x2019;s because in our jeans and T-shirts, we look more informal than Mom, and he knows how much she likes any excuse to dress up. I take the hint and sneak into my room to change. <br>When I come back downstairs, my mother stops lighting the candles on the mantelpiece. &#x201c;Derek, you&#x2019;re wearing your suit!&#x201d; <br>The only other time I&#x2019;ve worn this suit was to Mr. Mitchell&#x2019;s funeral last September. Mr. Mitchell was our next-door neighbor for the entire time we&#x2019;ve lived in this house. His obituary said he died &#x201c;after a long illness,&#x201d; but anybody in our neighborhood could&#x2019;ve told you it was from a brain tumor. Ms. Carlton across the street organized an alternating weekly meal calendar so Mrs. Mitchell didn&#x2019;t have to worry about cooking. Even though we and the other neighbors ended up cooking meals for three months, nobody complained. THAT&#x2019;S how nice the Mitchells are. <br>I grab my lapels and spin around. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Eve!&#x201d; <br>Somehow this coming year already seems different. I know I&#x2019;m only twelve, but it&#x2019;s as if I&#x2019;m about to catapult into feeling less like a little kid and more like an older one. I&#x2019;ll be a teenager soon, almost as cool as the upper classmen I sometimes watch from the corner of my eye at school. I could never talk with my friends Matt or Umberto about this. Carly, however, would love to sink her teeth into this subject. But the thought of discussing how mature we can be makes me whip off my suit jacket and start jumping on the couch. I grab the bag of confetti my dad went to three stores to find and toss handfuls around the room. My mutt, Bodi, barks and tries to jump onto the couch with me. <br>&#x201c;Hey, I thought we were waiting until midnight.&#x201d; Dad looks at my mother with his Something-Is-Wrong-with-Our-Son face. <br>&#x201c;Happy New Year!&#x201d; I jump off the couch and run into the kitchen to get my capuchin monkey, Frank. <br>&#x201c;Derek!&#x201d; My mother&#x2019;s voice is a bit louder than my father&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re not taking Frank out of his cage.&#x201d; <br>But it&#x2019;s too late&#x2014;Frank is now sitting on my shoulder, grabbing the confetti as I hurl it into the air. <br>&#x201c;You might be a little overtired,&#x201d; my father says. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only eleven thirty,&#x201d; I answer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not tired at all. In fact, I think we need more snacks.&#x201d; <br>My mother gazes at the half-empty trays of food we&#x2019;ve been munching on for hours. <br>&#x201c;We need to start the New Year with sliders,&#x201d; I suggest. <br>My parents look at each other, deciding what to do. On the one hand, it&#x2019;s late. On the other hand, they&#x2019;ve been encouraging me lately to cook some simple meals. <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Mom finally says. &#x201c;But wear an apron so you don&#x2019;t stain your clothes.&#x201d; <br>I take out the apron Dad uses to barbecue that says THIS GUY LOVES BACON and tie it around my waist. My mother gets a package of ground beef from the fridge, but I wave her away, saying I can do it myself. She scoops Frank into her arms and heads to the living room with my father. <br>I keep my eye on the clock as I form the beef into little patties. My mother pretends she&#x2019;s not looking into the kitchen, but I can tell she is. She doesn&#x2019;t realize that when it comes to hamburgers&#x2014;even mini ones&#x2014;I know what I&#x2019;m doing. <br>It&#x2019;s ten minutes to midnight and the burgers are almost done when I&#x2019;m suddenly faced with a crisis. WHERE IS THE KETCHUP? I rummage through the fridge, pulling out bottles and jars of condiments. <br>&#x201c;Six minutes to go!&#x201d; Dad calls. <br>From over my shoulder, I see my mom hold up her glass and my father pop open the bottles to prepare for midnight. (Champagne for them; sparkling cider for me.) <br>But before I can join them, an annoyingly loud BEEP BEEP BEEP fills the house. <br>I cover my ears with my hands as my mom runs into the kitchen. <br>&#x201c;Derek, how many times have we talked about turning on the vent when you cook hamburgers?&#x201d; She waves the dishtowel at the smoke detector. &#x201c;Jeremy, can you shut this off?&#x201d; <br>My father pokes the broomstick at the smoke detector while I hastily remove the now-burnt burgers from the stove. But the charred meat is the least of my problems&#x2014;Bodi and Frank are going ballistic from all the noise. I try to seize Frank but he&#x2019;s in the living room, shrieking almost as loudly as the smoke alarm. The television only adds to the noise when the two hosts start the countdown. <br>&#x201c;10! 9! 8!&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Frank jumps into my arms, colliding with the remote on the way. He must&#x2019;ve hit the channel button because the TV screen&#x2019;s now full of static and hissing noisily. <br>&#x201c;What on earth is going on?&#x201d; my mother shouts from the kitchen. <br>My father is on the stepladder, prying the battery out of the smoke detector. When it finally stops beeping, my mother hurries into the living room and presses different buttons on the three remotes until the screen returns to the special at L.A. Live. <br>&#x201c;There you have it!&#x201d; the host announces. &#x201c;A New Year&#x2019;s celebration for the books!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s the most spectacular fireworks show we&#x2019;ve ever seen!&#x201d; The other host waves to the crowds kissing and having fun at the strike of midnight we missed. <br>&#x201c;Happy New Year.&#x201d; My mom&#x2019;s acting happy as she makes the toast, but it&#x2019;s hard to miss the annoyance behind her smile. After we all hug, she puts Frank back in his cage and tells me it&#x2019;s time for bed. <br>I pull out the bag I have hidden behind the couch. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what I was thinking&#x2014;since Frank wears a diaper, he can be Baby New Year and Bodi can be Father Time.&#x201d; I hold out the sash and cotton-ball beard I made earlier. <br>&#x201c;Bed,&#x201d; my father says. <br>Bodi follows dutifully behind me as I storm through the living room. I make a big show of grabbing a burnt slider from the pan to take with me upstairs. <br>I get into my pajamas and shove my suit underneath the stand of my aquarium. Why did I think this year was going to be different? Why did I think I&#x2019;d finally get to be in charge of my own life? This year&#x2019;s going to be another 365 days of taking orders, going to school, doing chores, reading books, doing homework, etc., etc., etc. <br>They should change &#x201c;Happy New Year&#x201d; to &#x201c;Ha Ha!

Master this discipline and chess players can surely expect their results to improve dramatically. And yet there have been very few serious attempts in the past by chess authors to delve into this delicate topic, perhaps not surprisingly given its complexity and difficulty. In <i>Excelling at Chess Calculation</i>, Jacob Aagaard tackles the subject matter head on, unravelling the many secrets behind chess calculation and arming readers with the necessary tools to be able to calculate effectively at the chessboard. Aagaard pays particular attention to the searching practical questions like "when should players calculate?", "how can players discover candidate moves?", and "how long should players spend on critical moves?". A thorough study of this book will enable them to calculate with confidence in future games.<br><br>Highlights include:<br>*A crucial guide to the skill of chess calculation<br>*Ideal for both club and tournament players<br>*Written by a renowned chess coach and author<br></p><p><b>Jacob Aagaard</b> is an International Master from Denmark who has earned himself a deserved reputation as an industrious and no-nonsense chess author.

He takes readers behind the scenes at the Met, introduces curators and administrators, walks the empty corridors after hours, and shares what it&#x2019;s like to get the call that an ancient masterpiece has gone missing. <br><br></p><p>The Metropolitan Museum covers twelve acres in the heart of Manhattan and is filled with five thousand years of work by history&#x2019;s great artists known and unknown: Goya, da Vinci, Rembrandt, Warhol, Pollack, Egyptian mummies, Babylonian treasures, Colonial crafts, and Greek vases. John and a small staff of security professionals housed within the Museum were responsible for all of it. Over the years, John helped make the museum the state-of-the-art facility it is today and created a legacy in art security for decades to come.<br><br></p><p>Focusing on six thefts but filled with countless stories that span the late 1970s through the 21st Century, John opens the files on thefts, shows how museum personnel along with local and sometimes Federal Agents opened investigations and more often than not caught the thief. But of ultimate importance was the recovery of the artwork, including Celtic and Egyptian gold, French tapestries, Greek sculpture, and more.

The family has been placed under a poet&#39;s curse, threatening death to various members. Elements of the curse have already begun to play out. Reluctantly answering the call, Alexander leaves his home and his beloved Sarah and travels to Ulster, to find himself among a family torn apart by secrets and long-buried resentments. In the course of seeking out the author of the curse, Alexander becomes deeply entangled in a conflict that involves fugitive priests, displaced poets, rebellious plotters and agents of the king. Confronted by murder within his family, he finds the lines between superstition and faith, duty and loyalty are becoming increasingly blurred, while his Scottish homeland grows ever more remote.</p><p><p>Shona MacLean was born in Inverness and grew up in the Scottish highlands where her parents were hoteliers.

They were outsiders because they distanced themselves from the institutional church and also the societies around them in their respective eras. They believed that the church failed to take seriously the profound and disturbing relationship with God which is in Jesus Christ. From their position &#34;outside they questioned the assumptions, practices, and understandings of their church and secular contemporaries. Each produced profoundly original but difficult writings (often in uncompleted fragments), which Professor Allen has organized and interpreted for anyone who asks the question, &#34;How am I to be a Christian?</p><p>Diogenes Allen is Stuart Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Princeton Theological Seminary, where he taught for thirty-six years.

Across the political spectrum, commentators paste the label on forces and individuals who really have just one big thing in common: they are effective at blasting "elites" or "the establishment" for harming the interests and betraying the ideals of "the people" in nations that are committed, at least officially, to democratic principles.

Faith holds us as we respond to Christ&#x2019;s calling, negotiate life&#x2019;s challenges, and join in the work of bringing in God&#x2019;s kingdom.<br> <br> This introduction to Christian theology shows how various understandings of particular doctrines play out in relation to the way we live our lives. It explores the content of core Christian doctrines and celebrates the &#x201c;so what?&#x201d; of each. Using theological literature and Scripture, but also current events, sociology, fiction, and movies, Rigby shows that theology is key to how we come to understand and negotiate our world.&nbsp; Holding Faith contends that some approaches to Christian doctrine are preferable to others, making persuasive arguments for creative ways of believing that can enliven our lives, and the life of the world. Theology has relevance because it can stymie or transform. How will we hold our faith?<br> <br> &#x201c;Cynthia Rigby has written an accessible and lucid book of theological reflection for today&#x2019;s believers, seekers, and doubters. This is no small feat. The book succeeds in the daunting challenges of presenting Christian theology with clarity and completeness, with commitment and generosity. It is an admirable text for theology students, pastors, and all those interested in understanding more deeply their faith and life.&#x201d;<br> Leanne Van Dyk, President and Professor of Theology, Columbia Theological Seminary, Decatur, GA<br> <br> "This is an extraordinary book. Cynthia Rigby is a Reformed theologian, a minister, and a teacher. All of these gifts are evident in Holding Faith, as Rigby offers an eloquent introduction to Christian theology that is academically rich, pastorally sensitive, and profoundly accessible. She does not make theology accessible by watering it down, but rather by explaining it with compelling clarity. Holding Faith is perfect for seminarians, pastors, church groups, and curious souls; for those who are new to Christianity and those who have been studying and living Christian faith their entire lives. It will be an enormous blessing to those who teach theology and those who preach the gospel."<br> Shannon Craigo-Snell, Professor of Theology, Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Louisville, KY<br> <br> "Cindy Rigby's is a timely, necessary, and accessible voice in theological discourse, not only for those who together comprise Christendom but also for those who are curious enough about what Christian doctrines offer by way of challenge, critique, and comfort in our increasingly distracted, fractious world. Holding Faith is a prophetic, priestly, and pastoral defense of a faith tradition that historically contributed to this oppressive state of affairs - yet undoubtedly remains rife with redemptive possibility - for individuals, communities, nations, the cosmos. In its pages, Rigby provides church folks, people of other faiths, seminarians, and inquisitive "nones" with a "thoughtful place" to search out our private and corporate relationships to the God whom the doctrines signify, however imperfectly." <br> JoAnne Marie Terrell, Associate Professor of Theology, Ethics, and the Arts, Chicago Theological Seminary<br> <br> "For those of us who teach theology, it&#x2019;s rare to find a text that is accessible to those with no previous exposure to theology while also introducing readers in deep and expansive ways to major doctrinal teachings. But Rigby has managed to accomplish both here. This is a profoundly personal and invitational approach to thinking theologically in ways that demonstrate the relevance of ancient teachings for our world today. And it is also a serious engagement with the biblical text, a vast array of historical and contemporary theological voices, poetry, literature, film, and more&#x2014;this introduction to theology will empower readers to hold onto faith in new and exciting ways."<br> Deanna A.

As chairman of the history department at all black women&#x2019;s Spelman College, Zinn was an outspoken supporter of student activists in the nascent civil rights movement. In "The Southern Mystique," he tells of how he was asked to leave Spelman in 1963 after teaching there for seven years. "Behind every one of the national government&#x2019;s moves toward racial equality," writes Zinn in one 1965 essay, "lies the sweat and effort of boycotts, picketing, beatings, sit-ins, and mass demonstrations." He firmly believed that bringing people of different races and nationalities together would create a more compassionate world, where equality is a given and not merely a dream. These writings, which span decades, express Zinn&#x2019;s steadfast belief that the people have the power to change the status quo, if they only work together and embrace the nearly forgotten American tradition of civil disobedience and revolution. In clear, compassionate, and present prose, Zinn gives us his thoughts on the Abolitionists, the march from Selma to Montgomery, John F. Kennedy, picketing, sit-ins, and, finally, the message he wanted to send to New York University students about race in a speech he delivered during the last week of his life.</p><p>The visionary historical work of professor and activist HOWARD ZINN (1922&#x2013;2010) is widely considered one of the most important and influential of our era. After his experience as a bombardier in World War II, Zinn became convinced that&nbsp;there could no longer be such a thing as a &#x201c;just war,&#x201d; because the vast majority of victims in modern warfare are, increasingly, innocent civilians. In his books, including <i>A People&#x2019;s History of the United States</i>, its companion volume <i>Voices of a People&#x2019;s History of the United States</i>, and countless other titles, Zinn affirms the power of the people to influence the course of events.� "What can I say that will in any way convey the love, respect, and admiration I feel for this unassuming hero who was my teacher and mentor, this radical historian and people-loving &#x2018;trouble-maker,&#x2019; this man who stood with us and suffered with us? Howard Zinn was the best teacher I ever had, and the funniest." --Alice Walker<br>� "Professor Zinn writes with an enthusiasm rarely encountered in the leaden prose of academic history, and his text is studded with telling quotations from labor leaders, war resisters, and fugitive slaves." --Eric Foner, The New York Times Book Review</p><h2>The Mathematics of Magic (L. Sprague De Camp)</h2><p>Harold Shea is a psychologist who dreams of adventure, but never gets beyond learning to fence and occasionally showing up at staff meetings dressed in horseback riding garb. But when he learns that his boss, Dr. Reed Chalmers, has developed a theory which allows a person to transport himself to any world he can imagine, Harold Shea decides to give it a whirl. This volume includes all the De Camp and Pratt Enchanter stories.</p><p>L. Sprague de Camp was born in New York in 1907 and died in 2000. He got a BS in Aeronautical Engineering from Cal Tech in 1930 and later earned his MS. Before WWII he was one of the new writers recruited by John W. Campbell to launch the Golden Age of Astounding and became a distinguished writer of short SF. He was a Lieutenant Commander in the US Naval Reserve in WWII. After the war and for the next fifty years he was a full-time professional writer, mostly of SF and fantasy. He wrote over 100 SF&amp;F books, several hundred stories, and many non-fiction works in history, science, and biography.<br><br>De Camp is a winner of the Hugo and also a Grand Master Nebula.<br><br>L. Sprague de Camp spoke several languages and traveled world-wide. He has been chased by a hippopotamus in Uganda and by sea lions in the Galapagos Islands, seen tiger and rhinoceros from elephant back in India, been bitten by a lizard in the jungles of Guatemala, and spent Easter on Easter Island in the South Pacific. His autobiography, Time and Chance, published by Donald M. Grant in 1996 won the 1997 Hugo Award for best non-fiction.<br><br>Besides his solo works, de Camp is well-known for his fantasy collaborations with Fletcher Pratt and many books, mostly non-fiction, written with his wife Catherine Crook de Camp.Whoopee!&nbsp;De Camp and Pratt's&nbsp;Enchanter stories are all back in print at once. Legendary among sf and fantasy buffs as some of the brainiest, cheeriest, most affectionate exploitations of traditional and literary mythology, they're about a passel of scientifically savvy psychologists ensconced at a private&nbsp;psychiatric hospital in 1940s Middle America, who discover how to adjust reality via symbolic logic so they can travel to realms otherwise visitable only imaginarily. The youngest and brashest of them leads the way to the world of the Norse gods. In subsequent&nbsp;jaunts to the&nbsp;environs of Spenser's Faerie Queene, Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, the Finnish Kalevala, and the Irish T�in, his colleagues join him, and a denizen or two of the worlds visited come to this reality, too. Blending vigorous adventure and incidental humor, the stories, two more of which de Camp wrote four decades after Pratt's death in the 1950s,&nbsp;are like&nbsp;Indie Jones' exploits without the cussing and sneering. Their most obvious ancestor&nbsp;may be&nbsp;Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee, but unlike the rigidly antitraditional Twain, de Camp and Pratt love what they make fun of.

Benjamin Fawcett who made this abridged version of the original work wrote, 'The <i>Dying Thoughts</i> of Mr. Baxter chiefly present to our view what every Christian may attain, and what it is the highest interest, as well as the indispensable duty of every Christian to aspire after.<br><br>In this little book, we see Baxter wrestling with his own doubts and fears as he faces eternity, jealously examining his own heart, anxious to test his own sincerity, taking nothing for granted. Baxter wanted to die with every grace in his soul in full vigour. A man of life passions as ourselves, his <i>Dying Thoughts</i> provides much needed counsel, strength and comfort because it deals with the same conflicts, complaints and desires which fill our own hearts.</p><p>Richard Baxter (1615-1691) is chiefly remembered for the transformation his pastoral ministry effected on the town of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, during two periods of pastoral ministry there (interrupted by the English Civil War, in which he served as chaplain to the Parliamentary forces) between 1641 and 1661.<br><br>Born in Rowton, Shropshire, Baxter attended Wroxeter Grammar School but most of his study was done through his own private reading. He was ordained by John Thornborough, Bishop of Worcester, in 1638, and after a short time as a school-master in Dudley, became an assistant minister in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, before moving to Kidderminster in 1641. After leaving there in 1661, he preached in London, but was ejected from the Church of England the following year. <br><br>When almost fifty, Baxter married Margaret Charlton, one of his converts, who was in her early twenties. In spite of the difference in ages, they had an excellent marriage, and Margaret shared her husband s passion for Christ and the salvation of souls. Baxter suffered much ill-health, and the last twenty-nine years of his life were further 'embittered by repeated prosecutions, fines, imprisonment, and harassing controversies' (Ryle), but there was some respite with the accession of William and Mary in 1689, just two years before his death.</p><h2>Reader in Marxist Philosophy: From the Writings of Marx, Engels, and Lenin</h2><p>This volume is designed to provide a coherent and systematic presentation of the Marxist world outlook as given by the great exponents themselves.

That same morning, gunmen stunned the world by seizing the Grand Mosque in Mecca, creating a siege that trapped 100,000 people and lasted two weeks, inflaming Muslim rage against the United States and causing hundreds of deaths. But in the days before CNN and Al Jazeera, the press barely took notice. Trofimov interviews for the first time scores of direct participants in the siege, and draws upon hundreds of newly declassified documents. With the pacing, detail, and suspense of a real-life thriller, <i>The Siege of Mecca</i> reveals the long-lasting aftereffects of the uprising and its influence on the world today.</p></p><p><p><b>Yaroslav Trofimov</b>, an award-winning foreign correspondent for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, has extensively reported from Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries. He is also the author of <i>Faith atWar: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu</i>.<br><br>www.siegeofmecca.com</p><b>INTRODUCTION<br></b><br>The holy city of Mecca looked deceptively calm as the first dawn of the new century started to break behind craggy mountains.<br><br>Splashing his face with cold water, the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s bearded imam fastened a beige-hued cloak over his shoulders and muttered praises to the Lord. The time to lead the morning&#x2019;s first prayer was minutes away.<br><br>Under his window, the mosque&#x2019;s floodlit courtyard was filling up quickly. The hajj pilgrimage season, when this stadium-size enclosure was traversed by more than a million worshippers, had already ended. Yet Mecca remained jam-packed with the faithful. Many of them had spent the night inside Islam&#x2019;s holiest shrine, curling up on wool carpets in the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s multistory labyrinth of nearly a thousand rooms.<br><br>As usual, these worshippers camped along with their bundles, mattresses, and suitcases that nobody had bothered to check. Following custom, many hauled in wooden coffins, hoping that the imam would bestow on decomposing relatives inside the precious blessings that can only be received in such a sacred precinct.<br><br>Today, some of these coffins contained an unusual cargo: Kalashnikov assault rifles, Belgian-made FN-FAL guns, bullet belts, and an assortment of pistols.<br><br>The men who had smuggled this arsenal into the mosque sought an ambitious goal: to reverse the flow of world history, sparking a global war that would finally lead to Islam&#x2019;s total victory and to a destruction of arrogant Christians and Jews.<br>The date was the First of Muharram of Islam&#x2019;s year 1400&#x2013;which in calendars kept by infidel Westerners corresponded to November 20, 1979.<br><br>For the natives of Mecca, a city that lives off the flood of humanity that has coursed through its shrines since time immemorial, this Tuesday morning promised a particularly joyful occasion: New Year&#x2019;s day is when, according to tradition, the Meccans make a pilgrimage of their own to the Grand Mosque.<br><br>In darkness, thousands trekked to the outskirts of the city, shedding everyday clothes after a shower and returning in the pilgrims&#x2019; snow white <i>ihram </i>outfits&#x2013;two towel-like garments that symbolize purity and leave men&#x2019;s right shoulders exposed.<br><br>Mixing in with the locals were as many as 100,000 visitors from all over the world&#x2013;Pakistanis and Indonesians, Moroccans and Yemenis, Nigerians and Turks. Some were stragglers left behind after the hajj, entrepreneurial pilgrims who, year after year, try to offset the cost of their passage by reselling in Mecca&#x2019;s bazaars exotic wares from their remote homelands. Others had arrived in Mecca just to witness the turn of the<br>century&#x2013;a once-in-a-lifetime event. <br><br>Hidden in this human sea were hundreds of grim-faced rebels, many of them sporting red checkered headdresses. Some had been inside the mosque for days, reconnoitering its maze of corridors and passageways. Others were bused in during the night by a friendly religious academy. Yet others drove their own cars to Mecca this morning, arriving at the last minute and accompanied by children and wives to allay guards&#x2019; suspicions.<br><br>Most of these conspirators were Saudis of Bedouin stock, though their ranks also brimmed with foreigners, if such a word had a meaning for men who believed in the single citizenship of Islam. They even included African American converts, inspired by a new faith and hardened by race riots half a world away.<br><br>The color of the cloudless sky just started to turn from grayish to pink when the dawn ritual began, as it does that time of the year, at 5:18 a.m. <i>&#x201c;La ilaha ila Allah,&#x201d; </i>the deep-voiced prayer call rang from new loudspeakers affixed atop the mosque&#x2019;s seven towering minarets: &#x201c;There is no god but Allah.&#x201d;<br><br>Barefoot, worshippers knelt in the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s marble-paved courtyard. Clearing his throat, the imam picked up the microphone and read out the blessings. On his cue, the faithful prostrated themselves on the ground, in a vast succession of concentric circles that radiated from the Kaaba, an ancient cube draped in black silk embroidered with gold<br>that looms in the center of the enclosure.<br><br>Then, just as the imam concluded the prayer with wishes of peace, gunshots rang out. The crackling sound reverberated in the courtyard as in an echo chamber. Stunned worshippers spotted a young man, a rifle in his hands, walking briskly toward the Kaaba. Another shot sent into the air flocks of panicked pigeons that usually graze on the plaza<br>outside the Grand Mosque.<br><br>Rumors quickly swirled through the crowd. What could all this be? What was all that noise? Maybe there is an innocuous explanation, one man opined. Maybe the gunmen were bodyguards for some senior prince, or even the Saudi monarch, King Khaled, himself ? Maybe the gunfire was just some peculiar Saudi way to celebrate the New Year?<br><br>More knowledgeable worshippers shuddered. Firing a weapon in the Grand Mosque, they knew, was a grave sin. They couldn&#x2019;t recall the last time such a sacrilege had occurred. Pilgrims watched with angst as more and more gunmen closed in on the Kaaba, carrying weapons that had been extracted from uncrated coffins. The Grand Mosque&#x2019;s own police force, armed with nothing more threatening than sticks for beating misbehaving foreign pilgrims, melted away once two guards who attempted resistance fell dead by the gates.<br>Amid this commotion, the rebels&#x2019; leader, Juhayman al Uteybi, emerged from the depths of the mosque. A forty-three-year-old Bedouin preacher with magnetic black eyes, sensual lips, and shoulder-length hair that seamlessly blended into a black curly beard, Juhayman conveyed a sense of immediate authority despite his slender stature. Emulating a piety first displayed by Prophet Mohammed himself, he wore a traditional Saudi white robe that was cut short at midcalf to signal the rejection of material goods. Unlike his fellow gunmen, he was bareheaded, with only a thin green hair band keeping his unruly locks in check.<br><br>Flanked by three militants armed with rifles, pistols, and daggers, Juhayman started to elbow his way across the courtyard, toward the sacred Kaaba and the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s imam. The cleric, who had just turned his face away from the Kaaba and toward the distressing tumult among the believers, noticed that he was standing right next to a coffin.<br>This one contained a real cadaver; the dead child&#x2019;s relatives, oblivious to the mounting upheaval, were imploring the imam to bless the tiny corpse.<br><br>As the cleric obliged, reciting the sacred lines, recognition flickered on his face. He realized in these moments that Juhayman and some of the other gunmen, who now got disconcertingly close, had attended his lectures on Islam here in Mecca. This feeling turned to horror seconds later, as Juhayman unceremoniously pushed the cleric aside and seized the microphone. When the imam tried to wrestle back the mike, one of the intruders raised a sharp curved dagger and screamed at the top of his lungs, ready to stab.<br><br>A fright swept the crowd.<br><br>Picking up shoes, thousands rushed toward the enclosure&#x2019;s gates, only to find all fifty-one of them chained shut. Ragged-looking gun- men, muzzles staring into the crowd, barred all exits. Unsure of how to behave, some worshippers started chanting <i>&#x201c;Allahu Akbar&#x201d;&#x2013;</i>&#x201c;God is Greatest&#x201d;&#x2013;the Muslims&#x2019; invocation of faith in a moment of adversity. The gunmen unexpectedly joined in this chorus and it became louder and louder, spreading throughout the packed mosque until it turned into a deafening roar.<br><br>When this chanting subsided, Juhayman barked into the microphone a series of clipped military commands. Following his instructions, scores of his well-trained followers dispersed throughout the compound, setting up machine-gun nests atop the shrine&#x2019;s seven minarets. Trapped pilgrims were gang-pressed into aiding the rebels. Some had to roll up the thousands of heavy carpets inside the courtyard and prop them up against the chained<br>gates. The fittest were forced at gunpoint to climb the steep staircases to the tops of the minarets, carrying water and crates of ammunition. The takeover of Islam&#x2019;s holy of holies was swift and complete.<br><br>At their 89 meters (292 feet) of height, the mosque&#x2019;s minarets overlooked much of downtown Mecca, providing rebel snipers with a vast field of fire. Trigger fingers caressing the cold metal, they scanned neighboring streets for potential foes. &#x201c;If you see a government soldier who wants to raise his hand against you, have no pity and shoot him because he wants to kill you,&#x201d; Juhayman instructed these snipers in his guttural desert accent. &#x201c;Do not hesitate!&#x201d;<br>Under the minarets, even Saudis&#x2013;proficient in the local dialect&#x2013;had a hard time understanding what was going on. The crying of women, the coughing of elders, and the shuffling of bare feet filled the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s courtyard with an anxious hum. Many foreigners among the tens of thousands of hostages spoke no Arabic at all and stood transfixed in the turmoil, asking better-educated countrymen for explanation in a multitude of tongues.<br><br>The conspirators were prepared for linguistic problems, and wanted to be comprehended. Soon they grouped Pakistani and Indian pilgrims on one side of the mosque, with a Pakistani-born rebel interpreting the announcements in Urdu to bewildered compatriots. A cluster of Africans was provided with a speaker of English. &#x201c;Sit down, sit down and listen,&#x201d; Juhayman&#x2019;s gunmen yelled, rifle-butting those pilgrims who dared to disobey.<br><br>As cowed worshippers finally settled in fearful attention, the mysterious group indicated that its authority now extended well beyond the Grand Mosque to Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s commercial capital and to the second of the country&#x2019;s two holy cities. &#x201c;Mecca, Medina, and Jeddah are now in our hands,&#x201d; the rebels declared through the shrine&#x2019;s public-address system, so powerful that their words could be heard throughout central Mecca.<br><br>Then Juhayman handed the microphone to an aide better versed in classical Arabic speech. It was high time to explain the purpose of this daring venture.<br><br>For the next hour, the Grand Mosque&#x2019;s loudspeakers relayed the uprising&#x2019;s shocking message to the world&#x2019;s one billion Muslims, announcing that an ancient prophecy had been fulfilled at last and that the hour of final reckoning was being struck. By the time this speech, occasionally interspersed with gunshots, was over and the loudspeakers fell silent, panic infected the whole of central Mecca. Even waiters at the outdoor caf�s near the mosque had all run away.<br>Thus began a drawn-out battle that would drench Mecca in blood, marking a watershed moment for the Islamic world and the West. Within hours, this outrage would prompt a global diplomatic crisis, spreading death and destruction thousands of miles away. American pilots and European commandos would all have to be involved in restoring the shrines of Islam to the House of Saud. Soon, American lives would be lost, and America would find itself more isolated than ever in the increasingly hostile Muslim universe.<br><br>The consequences of this forgotten crisis&#x2013;which remains blotted out of history books in Saudi Arabia and many other Muslim lands&#x2013;last to this day.<br><br>In tackling Juhayman&#x2019;s brazen attack on its holiest shrine, the Saudi government showed sickening arrogance, cruel incompetence, and bewildering disregard for the truth. The royal family&#x2019;s image was sullied forever. Many Muslims in Saudi Arabia and beyond, including the young Osama Bin Laden, were so repulsed by the carnage in Mecca that their loyalty started to fracture. In following years, they drifted toward open opposition to the House of Saud and its American backers. The fiery ideology that inspired Juhayman&#x2019;s men to murder and mayhem in Islam&#x2019;s holy of holies mutated with time into increasingly more vicious strains, culminating in al Qaeda&#x2019;s death cult.<br><br>By a coincidence of global events, it is precisely this ideology that American policy makers&#x2013;and the House of Saud&#x2013;found right after the crisis in Mecca to be of great value on the Cold War battlefronts. Instead of being suppressed, Juhayman&#x2019;s brutal brand of Islam was encouraged and nurtured as it metastasized across the planet since 1979. Today, hordes of his spiritual heirs are busy blowing up airplanes, tourist hotels, and commuter trains on four continents, self-satisfied smiles of true believers curling their lips.<br><br>The significance of the Mecca uprising was missed at the time even by the most sharp-eyed observers. Too many other threats preoccupied the West. The seizure of the Grand Mosque&#x2013;the first large-scale operation by an international jihadi movement in modern times&#x2013;was shrugged off as a local incident, an anachronistic throwback to Arabia&#x2019;s Bedouin past.<br><br>But with the benefit of hindsight, it is painfully clear: the countdown to September 11, to the terrorist bombings in London and Madrid, and to the grisly Islamist violence ravaging Afghanistan and Iraq all began on that warm November morning, in the shade of the Kaaba.</p><h2>One Last Read: The Collected Works of the World&#39;s Slowest Sportswriter</h2><p>In a career that has spanned over thirty five years, Ray Didinger has seen and written about every sport, team, and athlete that has made a mark in American and the world.&nbsp; In this collection of profiles, articles, and columns from his days in the Bulletin, the Daily News and through his current life on television and film, Ray Didinger takes his readers to the major moments and events that have measure the life of sports in Philadelphia, this country, and the world.</p><p>Ray Didinger is one of the best sportswriters Philadelphia has ever read.&nbsp; A sports journalist, first for the <i>Bulletin</i> and then for the <i>Daily News</i>, he never missed a deadline in over 25 years.&nbsp; But as he admits, there have been close calls, much to his editors' chagrin.&nbsp; He was widely known as "the World's Slowest Sportswriter."<br><br>Of the thousands of articles, columns, and profiles he has penned over the years, Didinger has selected his finest work to be included in this book.&nbsp; <b>One Last Read</b> contains entire chapters for each of the professional Philadelphia teams -- the Phillies, the Flyers, the Sixers and of course, the Eagles.&nbsp; But that is only half of the story.&nbsp; Included here is his coverage of college sports and the Olympics as well as the ful text of the speech he delivered in Canton, Ohio when he presented his boyhood idol, Tommy McDonald, for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.<br><br>There are also some strongly-worded opinion pieces -- about former Eagles owner (and legendary high-roller) Leonard Tose, the career of Woody Hayes, and much, much more.<br><br>Didinger's introduction -- engaging, warm, whitty, and insightful -- is among his finest writing.&nbsp; For longtime readers, this essential collection of Didinger's work was worth the wait.Ray Didinger has won four Emmy Awards as a writer and producer at NFL Films.

Through this series of eloquent letters written to a life-long friend, author Eugene Peterson demonstrates friendship as a means to Christian maturity. The topics covered in this warm and highly personal correspondence are broad and varied, but one thing comes through with constancy and clarity: there is great value in a wise, experienced friend to help us see more clearly and to strengthen our growth in faith and godliness.</p><p>Honest and prayerful conversation is often hard to come by. In our reliance upon the Bible as our source of counsel, many of us overlook what the Scriptures themselves say about the importance of godly friends as a source of wisdom and practical direction for living. Eugene Peterson believes that counsel between companions engaged in a common task--that of following Christ--needs to be revived among believers. In The Wisdom of Each Other, Peterson portrays a relationship between a long-time believer and a seeker wanting to renew his commitment to Christ as they discuss the importance of living out their faith. Drawing from his own experience, Peterson helps us see how God can speak through wise, faith-filled companions, offering guidance, encouragement, and counsel for the challenges and concerns of everyday living.Eugene H. Peterson is professor of spiritual theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia. In addition to The Message, he has written numerous books, including A Long Obedience In The Same Direction, Leap Over a Wall and Working The Angles.

Despite being a first-generation Canadian, she never felt at home in the West. And even though she attended Islamic schools and wore the hijab since age nine, Yasmine never fit in with her Muslim family either.

In movies, books, and magazines, at memorial sites and public ceremonies, and on television and the internet, Pearl Harbor lives in a thousand guises and symbolizes dozens of different historical lessons. In <i>A Date Which Will Live, </i>historian Emily S. Rosenberg examines the contested meanings of Pearl Harbor in American culture.<br> Rosenberg considers the emergence of Pearl Harbor&#x2019;s symbolic role within multiple contexts: as a day of infamy that highlighted the need for future U.S. military preparedness, as an attack that opened a "back door" to U.S. involvement in World War II, as an event of national commemoration, and as a central metaphor in American-Japanese relations. She explores the cultural background that contributed to Pearl Harbor&#x2019;s resurgence in American memory after the fiftieth anniversary of the attack in 1991. In doing so, she discusses the recent &#x201c;memory boom&#x201d; in American culture; the movement to exonerate the military commanders at Pearl Harbor, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short; the political mobilization of various groups during the culture and history "wars" of the 1990s, and the spectacle surrounding the movie <i>Pearl Harbor.</i> Rosenberg concludes with a look at the uses of Pearl Harbor as a historical frame for understanding the events of September 11, 2001.</p><p>&#34;Emily S. Rosenberg has given us a fine, concise study of war, memory, and mythmaking in America that will prove equally appealing to teachers, students, and general readers.&#34;--John W.

She lives in Piano, Texas. </p><p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>Soup is not just another meal -- it's comfort in a bowl, love on a spoon, satisfaction simmering on the stove. Nothing makes a house feel more like a home than a pot of freshly made soup. And all this goodness comes together so easily. Whether you make it all from scratch, starting from the stock up, or you purchase stock and a few other ingredients for a quick and easy meal, soup will never fail you.</p> <p>While 300 soups is a lot of recipes, there is no end to the possible combinations. You'll find that many of the recipes can be made with items that are already in your pantry or refrigerator and can be cooked and on your table in under an hour.</p> <p>Our book begins with the Stock Basics chapter, which has recipes for the foundation of all soups: stocks. Here we guide you through the ins and outs of making your own stock. You'll be surprised at how easy it is and what a flavorful difference it makes. We include many different kinds of stocks, such as mushroom, veal and roasted vegetable, as well as the more familiar chicken and beef stock recipes. We hope you'll experiment, using some of the more unusual stocks in place of beef or chicken stock in your soups.</p> <p>To make the book easy to use, we've divided the soup recipes among 10 chapters, such as Fresh from the Garden Vegetable Soups, Hearty Soups for Meat Lovers and Chow Down Chowders, so you'll always know where to turn when you crave a particular type of soup.</p> <p>Because soup is embraced by every culture, we've included a comprehensive selection of international soups: iconic soups such as French Onion, Mulligatawny, Pasta Fagiole and Tortilla Soup, as well as some you might not be familiar with but will soon come to love, such as Vatap�, a Brazilian black bean soup, or African Peanut Soup, made with coconut milk and sweet potatoes.</p> <p>While you may be accustomed to thinking of soup as an appetizer or a main course, soup also makes an excellent dessert! Our Just Dessert Soups chapter includes more than 20 recipes for mouthwatering dessert soups made with fresh fruits and chocolate.</p> <p>And because we think almost every soup benefits from a garnish, we've included an entire chapter of toppings and garnishes called Gilding the Lily. For instance, Split Pea Soup is wonderful on its own, but when paired with Pumpernickel Croutons, it becomes something truly special. We hope you'll look at this chapter every time you make soup and experiment with all the possibilities.</p> <p>We loved feeding our families these comforting soups, and we hope that once you begin cooking with our recipes, these soups will become your family's new favorites as well.</p></p><h2>The Ecclesiastical Text: Criticism, Biblical Authority &amp; the Popular Mind</h2><p>This is a collection of essays written by Theodore Letis, the Director of the Institute of Renaissance and Reformation Studies, over a period between 1987-1997 and published in journals both popular and academic, while he was a doctoral candidate at the University of Edinburgh. Some are popular, most are rather technical studies treating translation philosophy, text criticism, the Protestant orthodox dogmatic traditions of the seventeenth-century. It also contains four important book reviews and two appendices.In these essays, Letis presents a rigorous defense of the use of the Textus Receptus, or the Ecclesiastical Text, over the various critical texts which have been heavily used since the time of B.B. Warfield. Letis challenges the prevailing notion that Biblical authority is to be found in the original autographs of Scripture by demonstrating a theological shift in the later nineteenth into early twentieth centuries, and consequently arguing that authority is to be found in the apographa, or the text preserved in the church.</p><p></p><h2>Wish Lanterns: Young Lives in New China</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Ash&#x2019;s book paints a telling portrait of this most restless generation raised in a system that has provided them with unprecedented personal opportunities while denying them political ones . . .

He is the author of eleven previous novels, including the best-selling <i>Nature Girl, Skinny Dip, Sick Puppy,</i> and <i>Lucky You,</i> and three best-selling children's books, <i>Hoot, Flush, </i>and <i>Scat. </i>His most recent work of nonfiction is <i>The Downhill Lie: A Hacker's Return to a Ruinous Sport.</i> He also writes a weekly column for <i>The Miami Herald.</i>1<br><br>On the fifteenth of March, two hours before sunrise, an emergency medical technician named Jimmy Campo found a sweaty stranger huddled in the back of his ambulance. It was parked in a service alley behind the Stefano Hotel, where Jimmy Campo and his partner had been summoned to treat a twenty-two-year-old white female who had swallowed an unwise mix of vodka, Red Bull, hydrocodone, birdseed and stool softener&#x2014;in all respects a routine South Beach 911 call, until now.<br><br>The stranger in Jimmy Campo&#x2019;s ambulance had two 35-mm digital cameras hanging from his fleshy neck, and a bulky gear bag balanced on his ample lap. He wore a Dodgers cap and a Bluetooth ear set. His ripe, florid cheeks glistened damply, and his body reeked like a prison laundry bag.<br><br>&#x201c;Get out of my ambulance,&#x201d; Jimmy Campo said.<br><br>&#x201c;Is she dead?&#x201d; the man asked excitedly.<br><br>&#x201c;Dude, I&#x2019;m callin&#x2019; the cops if you don&#x2019;t move it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s with her up there&#x2014;Colin? Shia?&#x201d;<br><br>The stranger outweighed Jimmy Campo by sixty-five pounds but not an ounce of it was muscle. Jimmy Campo, who&#x2019;d once been a triathlete, dragged the intruder from the vehicle and deposited him on the sticky pavement beneath a streetlight.<br><br>&#x201c;Chill, for Christ&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; the man said, examining his camera equipment for possible damage. Stray cats tangled and yowled somewhere in the shadows.<br><br>Inside the ambulance, Jimmy Campo found what he was looking for: a sealed sterile packet containing a coiled intravenous rig to replace the one that the female overdose victim had ripped from her right arm while she was thrashing on the floor.<br><br>The stranger struggled to his feet and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a thousand bucks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When you bring her downstairs, lemme take a picture.&#x201d; The man dug into the folds of his stale trousers and produced a lump of cash. &#x201c;You gotta job to do, and so do I. Here&#x2019;s a grand.&#x201d;<br><br>Jimmy Campo looked at the money in the stranger&#x2019;s hand. Then he glanced up at the third floor of the hotel, where his partner was almost certainly dodging vomit.<br><br>&#x201c;Is she famous or somethin&#x2019;?&#x201d; Jimmy Campo asked.<br><br>The photographer chuckled. &#x201c;Man, you don&#x2019;t even know?&#x201d;<br><br>Jimmy Campo was thinking about the fifty-two-inch high-def that he&#x2019;d seen on sale at Brands Mart. He was thinking about his girlfriend on a rampage with his maxed-out MasterCard at the Dadeland Mall. He was thinking about all those nasty letters from his credit union.<br><br>&#x201c;Whoever she is, she&#x2019;s not dead,&#x201d; he told the photographer. &#x201c;Not tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cool.&#x201d; The man continued to hold out the wad of hundreds in the glow of the streetlight, as if teasing a mutt with raw hamburger. He said, &#x201c;All you gotta do, before loading her in the wagon, just pull down the covers and step away so I can get my shot. Five seconds is all I need.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be pretty. She&#x2019;s a sick young lady.&#x201d; Jimmy Campo took the crumpled money and smoothed it into his wallet.<br><br>&#x201c;Is she awake at least?&#x201d; the photographer asked.<br><br>&#x201c;On and off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you could see her eyes in a picture, right? She&#x2019;s got those awesome sea-green eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>Jimmy Campo said, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t notice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You really don&#x2019;t know who she is? Seriously?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who do you work for, anyway?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A limited partnership,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;Me, myself and I.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And where can I see this great picture you&#x2019;re gonna take?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everywhere. You&#x2019;ll see it everywhere,&#x201d; the stranger said.<br><br>Eighteen minutes later, Jimmy Campo and his partner emerged from the Stefano Hotel guiding a collapsible stretcher upon which lay a slender, motionless form.<br><br>The photographer was surprised at the absence of a retinue; no bodyguards or boyfriends or hangers-on. A lone Miami Beach police officer followed the stretcher down the alley. When the photographer began snapping pictures, the cop barely reacted, making no effort to shield the stricken woman from the flash bursts. That should have been a clue.<br><br>Sliding closer, the paparazzo intercepted the stretcher as it rolled with an oscillating squeak toward the open end of the ambulance. True to his word, Jimmy Campo tugged down the sheet and stepped away, leaving an opening.<br><br>&#x201c;Cherry!&#x201d; the photographer shouted at the slack face. &#x201c;Cherry, baby, how &#x2019;bout a big smile for your fans?&#x201d;<br><br>The young woman&#x2019;s incurious eyes were open. They were not sea-green, mint-green, pea-green or any hue of green. They were brown.<br><br>&#x201c;Goddammit,&#x201d; the photographer growled, lowering his Nikon.<br><br>The woman on the stretcher grinned behind the oxygen mask and blew him a kiss.<br><br>Grabbing at Jimmy Campo&#x2019;s arm, the photographer cried, &#x201c;Gimme back my money!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mister, I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about,&#x201d; said the paramedic, elbowing the sweaty creep back into the shadows.</p><h2>Endless (Embrace, 4)</h2><p><p><strong>LOVE WILL KILL US ALL</strong></p> <p>Violet Eden thought she was getting things under control.

"I don't want to talk to you."</p> <p>She put her hands on her hips, looking down at me like...like...like a mother. My mind scrambled.</p> <p>I harrumphed. "What? Did you hit your head tumbling down from your cloud or something?"</p> <p>Evelyn blinked, stunned for a moment, before she turned away from me and placed a pillow under Dad's head. She wiped the hair back from his face.</p> <p>Her hand lingered. Mine fisted.</p> <p>"Why don't you just go?" I spat out, furious that she continued to make herself comfortable in my home and so easily ignore me. "Leaving seems to be your thing."</p> <p>She felt for Dad's pulse and studied his face. "He'll come around soon."</p> <p>Oh my God. How can this be happening?</p> <p>It was all too much. After losing to Phoenix in Greece, I'd just wanted to see Dad, tell him the truth about who and what I am, and see if we could mend our relationship. Instead, my returned-from-the-dead mother had oh-so-calmly shoved a fist in his face with supernatural strength.</p> <p>"You could've broken his jaw," I said, at a loss to know how to deal with this situation. My mother was a stranger to me. All I knew about her was that she'd traded me in the moment I was born, given my destiny to angels, and committed Dad and me to a lifetime of unanswered questions. Now she was back and I had zero concept of how to handle her.</p> <p>I strode into the kitchen, wet a towel, and scooped in a handful of crushed ice before coming back to Dad's side to dab at his forehead.</p> <p>"Before either one of us says anything to James, we should talk," Evelyn said, sitting on the coffee table opposite, her fire-blue eyes darting between Dad and me. I could just imagine what was going through her mind.</p> <p>Bet you never thought you'd be faced with us again-and never wanted to.</p> <p>"You mean you need time to think fast so you can bail on him again." Every word tasted sour. I needed to get a grip. I was damned if this woman was going to push me over the edge. "Look..." I blew out a breath. "Don't bother with the balcony. It's a nightmare to jump down-just use the front door and hide your face from the security guys on your way. When Dad wakes up, I'll tell him there was an intruder and that he was attacked. He'll think he was seeing things and let it go."</p> <p>She looked at me, eyes wide. "Do you really think I would just run out the door?"</p> <p>I almost laughed at her offended tone. "Do you really think you won't?"</p> <p>She sighed and glanced at Dad again. "You inherited his stubbornness." She looked like she wanted to say more but shook her head, frustrated. The movement gave me a small amount of satisfaction. "I'm not going anywhere."</p> <p>Come. On.</p> <p>I stared at her, wondering if I had time to literally throw her out before he woke up.</p> <p>Christ. I can just picture Dad waking up to see his daughter and dead wife ripping each other apart.</p> <p>"Please, just go," I said. "You don't belong here."</p> <p>She crossed her arms. But I could tell she was tensed and ready, waiting to see if things were going to get physical.</p> <p>My eyes narrowed and the temptation to force her hand rose to the surface. But we both knew I couldn't risk it.</p> <p>"Does he know what you are?" she asked, her shoulders relaxing.</p> <p>I slumped back onto my heels. "No. But he knows something. He's read your letter and seen my markings. I was planning to tell him today."</p> <p>She nodded, taking it all in. "Well, then, I arrived at the right time. We'll tell him together. Everything."</p> <p>"You're so thoughtful," I sniped.</p> <p>Dad started to stir.</p> <p>"Fine," I said. "But when you start flinging lies in the air, don't expect me to go along with them. Unlike you, my version of &#x2018;everything' will actually contain the truth."</p> <p>Before she could respond, Dad's eyes fluttered open.</p> <p>"Violet?" he said, his voice crackly and uncertain.</p> <p>"Dad, it's okay," I responded, putting a hand on his shoulder. "You're home and safe." I gave Evelyn a warning look then turned my attention back to my father. "No one will hurt you again."</p> <p>His eyes came into focus and, despite his confusion, he smiled at me. I smiled back. Then he saw Evelyn. He gasped and I had to grab hold of him to keep him steady as he scrambled to sit up.</p> <p>"Dad, breathe. You're going to have another panic attack," I said as soothingly as possible.</p> <p>His eyes were so wide, they were mostly white. "Oh God. I didn't imagine it. Who are you? You...You look..." he stammered.</p> <p>Evelyn took a deep breath and locked her eyes on his. "You took me on a carriage ride through Central Park on our first date. You only had enough money for half the trip, so we were dumped in the middle of the park and had to walk back. You picked flowers for me along the way. When you said good-bye that night, you kissed me and said, &#x2018;This is only the beginning.' We met for breakfast the following day and every day after that, for the next six months. The first morning we didn't have breakfast together was our wedding day."</p> <p>Dad was frozen. I think I was frozen too. From one small speech, I now knew more about their relationship than Dad had ever told me. And it only made me more livid.</p> <p>How could she have done this to him?</p> <p>Time seemed to stand still. Evelyn looking at Dad, imploring him to accept this impossibility; Dad staring back at her with disbelief. My eyes shot between the two of them...my parents.</p> <p>"Evelyn?" He breathed the word.</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>"Are you..." He swallowed. "Are you a ghost?"</p> <p>"No," Evelyn said calmly. "I'm human. Mostly." Her brow furrowed. "I think."</p> <p>"Oh," Dad said.</p> <p>I rolled my eyes at her.</p> <p>Great clarification.</p> <p>"James, Violet and I have a lot to explain. We would like to be able to tell you everything if you're willing to listen, but we must warn you-once you know, you will become a part of this world..." She glanced down, a sadness creeping into her voice. "And you can never go back."</p> <p>I ground my jaw. I hated that she was right. I also hated the way she united us. There was no "we." She'd kept her secrets from Dad since the moment they had met. Everything had been a lie. Then, when I was born, she'd accepted an angel's bargain-probably for a penthouse suite in Heaven-and committed me to a life as a Grigori. Sure, I'd had to choose whether to accept it, but I was learning fast; angels are determined beings and what they want, they usually get.</p> <p>She would have known that too.</p> <p>Worse, not only had she handed over my fate the moment I was born, she'd given me to an angel of the Sole, making me the one and only human Grigori to have ever been empowered by the highest-ranking and most mysterious order.</p> <p>Yeah, I'm high up in the freak department.</p> <p>"Violet?" Dad said, interrupting my thoughts, his face still a picture of shock.</p> <p>I sighed, drawing my eyes away from Evelyn. "It's her, Dad. I...found her when I was in Greece. Are you sure you're up to hearing the whole story?"</p> <p>He shifted position and began rolling up his sleeves, the way he did when he'd set his mind on something. He took my hand, gripping it tight, and cast a wary glance in Evelyn's direction.</p> <p>"I know my daughter. I knew my wife. You look incredibly like her, but she died seventeen years ago and you...you look the way she did the day she died." He glanced at her wayward hair. "Almost."</p> <p>I smiled, proud of Dad for not just falling into her arms.</p> <p>"I will hear the entire story, nothing spared." He gestured to Evelyn. "You know things other people wouldn't, but that doesn't prove anything as far as I'm concerned." He let go of my hand, stretched his arm across the back of the sofa, and raised his eyebrows. "Start talking."</p> <p>It must have taken every ounce of courage not to break down right there, not to grab Evelyn and hold her tight-whether he believed it was really her or not. Dad loved her like he loved no other person in this world and I knew nothing had changed that over the past seventeen years.</p> <p>Evelyn was staring at him, a thoughtful look on her face. "You've changed," she said finally.</p> <p>"Apparently you haven't. Talk!" Dad demanded.</p> <p>Go, Dad!</p> <p>Evelyn saw the amusement in my eyes and rolled hers in response.</p> <p>"I'm human, like you," she began, "born to two human parents, but when my mother was in late pregnancy, she had a placenta rupture. The doctors were able to deliver me, but it was a different time then-they didn't have the resources they do now. My mother did not survive."</p> <p>My heart sank. I had always thought there was nothing worse than knowing my mother had only held me for a few short minutes. But there was; I could see it in her eyes when she told the story. Her mother had never held her at all.</p> <p>Dad shifted in his seat. "Evelyn never told me that," he said cautiously.</p> <p>She smiled sadly. "I was scared to give away too much information. I was always careful-it was the way I was trained."</p> <p>Dad maintained a stoic expression. I think it was the only way he could go on.</p> <p>"Continue," he said.</p> <p>Evelyn nodded. "When a human life is brought into the world, the moments following his or her first breath are vital. Newborns are bathed in the aura of new life. If a child suffers the loss of like-blood, most commonly a parent, within the first twelve days of life, he or she is also overwhelmed by the aura of new death. When the two opposing forces are so strong, a doorway can be created."</p> <p>"What kind of doorway?" Dad asked, now cautiously glancing in my direction. He was already connecting the dots.</p> <p>"When new life combines with new death, it creates a kind of tunnel." She took a deep breath. I found myself doing the same. "A tunnel that...an angel can use to transfer a piece of its essence to the body. At seventeen, the child is given the choice of whether or not to embrace the gifts and responsibilities that come with having that essence." She looked at me.</p> <p>I'd practically stopped breathing.</p> <p>"An...angel?" Dad repeated slowly.</p> <p>"Yes, James. Angels are very real. They aren't what you probably think they are-they aren't always kind and they aren't always cruel, but they are definitely always active and a controlling force over our world. If a person who carries an angel essence chooses to embrace, he or she is given-among other things-increased strength, speed, weapons both internal and external, the ability to sense otherworldly beings, a healing capacity, a partner in arms, and...while still susceptible to mortality by harm, a much-extended lifespan, aging increasingly slower the older we get." She looked down. "We can live for many hundreds of years."</p> <p>I was impressed Dad was still in the room-and upright. He cleared his throat. "How old are you?"</p> <p>Evelyn didn't even blink. "I was 187 years old when I died. Now I'm back, I guess you could say I've passed my bicentennial."</p> <p>Dad looked at me, wide-eyed. "Violet, have you been listening to this? Surely this isn't what has been going on with you for the past months? This can't be real."</p> <p>"I wish it wasn't, Dad." I took his hand. It was hot and clammy. "But she is who she says and what she says. And just as an angel gave his essence to Evelyn...I'm what they call a Grigori. Part human but also part angel. I have abilities-but you've already seen my wrists." I bit my lip nervously, remembering his severe reaction at seeing the swirling silver markings before I'd taken off to Santorini.</p> <p>As he looked at them, they started to move with a magic none of us could comprehend, churning like a river of mercury around my wrists. Delicate feathered tips began to emerge in the patterns, matching the design on Evelyn's wristbands. Dad glanced between us and I noticed Evelyn staring, mesmerized too.</p> <p>"She said you had to choose to do this. Did you want this, Violet?"</p> <p>"Not at the beginning. I wanted to finish school, become an artist, be...normal. After everything that happened..." My voice caught at the memory of the attack.</p> <p>Dad nodded, not making me say it aloud. Evelyn watched on silently. There was no way I was about to explain it to her-the way that teacher had attacked me at my old school. Dad and I had done everything we could to try and get life back on track after the court case and all the awful questions.</p> <p>"What happened?"</p> <p>I glared at her and continued speaking to Dad.</p> <p>"Grigori all have a partner. A person whose power complements ours the most. Grigori can help to start the healing process in their partners when they are injured. The only problem is, apart from me, Grigori can only heal their own partner. Lincoln's mine."</p> <p>"What do you mean, &#x2018;apart from' you?" Evelyn butted in.</p> <p>"I'm not here to answer your questions!" I snapped. Again, I turned back to Dad. "I have some extra...abilities. Nothing major," I said with a shrug. Dad looked at me like I'd just turned green.</p> <p>"Lincoln was hurt," Evelyn said, putting it together.</p> <p>I nodded, remembering what it had been like to know he would die without my help. The overwhelming fear of a world that didn't include him was all I needed to know I'd made the right choice.</p> <p>"He was dying," I said.</p> <p>"You became..." He couldn't find the words. "This!" He pointed to my wrists. "This was for Lincoln?"</p> <p>His disappointment stung, but I stayed calm to give him time to process. "He would've died. I don't regret my choice, Dad. And now I'm Grigori and that means I'm a warrior."</p> <p>"A warrior against what?" he barked, incredulous.</p> <p>I took a deep breath. "Angels who exile themselves from their rightful place and take on human form."</p> <p>"Fallen angels?" he clarified. "You fight fallen angels?"</p> <p>"Yes. They're strong and powerful and...evil. They can do things that others can't and they are intent on taking this world for their own."</p> <p>"Sweetheart, there are no fallen angels walking around in this world." He shook his head, as if trying to bring himself back to reality.</p> <p>"Yes there are. You even know one." I braced myself and bit down on the inside of my cheek. "Phoenix is an exiled angel."</p> <p>"Phoenix? That guy that you were hanging out with a while back?"</p> <p>I nodded. Dad had never liked him.</p> <p>"You brought Phoenix into your home?" Evelyn asked, her tone carrying both disbelief and accusation.</p> <p>I flashed her a quick smile. I didn't owe her an explanation.</p> <p>"But you just said they were all evil," Dad continued.</p> <p>I nodded again, this time with regret. "Phoenix has human blood in him too, and that means he can seem more human than other exiles. He fo...</p></p><h2>Short walks in the Cotswolds</h2><p>All the walks are five miles or under in length and can easily be completed in less than three hours. 20 walks are included and use clear maps to show the route plus easy to follow walk descriptions.</p><p>Explore the world through accurate and up-to-date mapping.&#34;unspoilt, family-friendly walks&#34; Walk magazine</p><h2>THE UNSTOPPABLE WASP: G.I.R.L.

Engineers found ways to cut through the forest, medical visionaries conquered the diseases, and workers endured the jungle. Yet there were also broken treaties, political tyranny, and the tragedy of thousands of West Indian workers forced to live in awful, segregated conditions. </p><p> <b><i>Wonders of the World</i> series</b> </p><p> The winner of numerous awards, this series is renowned for Elizabeth Mann's ability to convey adventure and excitement while revealing technical information in engaging and easily understood language. The illustrations are lavishly realistic and accurate in detail but do not ignore the human element. Outstanding in the genre, these books are sure to bring even the most indifferent young reader into the worlds of history, geography, and architecture. </p><p> <i>"One of the ten best non-fiction series for young readers."</i><br> - Booklist </p></p><p><p> <b>Elizabeth Mann</b> has written nine Wonders of the World books, an award-winning series. She is former teacher in New York, holds an M.S.E. and is cofounder of Mikaya Press. </p><p> <b>Fernando Rangel</b> was born in Bogata, Colombia, and grew up in Queens, N.Y. He earned a B.F.A. at the School of Visual Arts and trained at the Chatauqua School of Art. </p>Mann (The Great Wall, 1997, etc.) offers the older end of the picture-book set a concrete, engaging narrative on another of the man-made wonders of the world. Opening her tale with the failure of the French, under Ferdinand de Lesseps, to construct their own canal in Panama, Mann quickly moves into the details of President Teddy Roosevelt's obsession with the project; he broke international law by encouraging and aiding Panama's rebellion for independence in 1903. The resulting treatythough unfair to Panamagave Roosevelt all the leverage he needed, and despite yellow fever and malaria, America soon poured thousands of workers and millions of dollars into this enterprise. While there were excellent living conditions for American workers in Panama, those conditions were not duplicated for Caribbean laborers: ``Black Caribbeans suffered a higher rate of death from accidents and disease than any other group.'' Rangel's lavish full-color illustrations capture the immense scale of the canal's construction, from the damming of the Chagres River to the construction of the locks on a four-page, fold-out spread. Mann and Rangel have created an exceptional resource for the classroom, as well as an epic piece of storytelling.

Millions of readers love the outrageous lifestyle, fashion and capricious escapades of the elegant bon ton, and no one has captured that world better than Georgette Heyer, with universally beloved novels such as &#34;Regency Buck&#34;, &#34;The Grand Sophy&#34; and &#34;Friday&#39;s Child&#34;. &#34;Georgette Heyer&#39;s Regency World&#34; is the ultimate, definitive guide to Georgette Heyer&#39;s wonderful and enchanting realm: her heroines, her villains and dashing heroes, the shops, clubs and towns they frequented, the parties and seasons they celebrated, how they ate, drank, dressed, socialized, shopped and drove. An utterly delightful and fun read, beautifully illustrated and compelling in its historical detail, this is a must-have for any Georgette Heyer fan.</p><p>Jennifer Kloester was born in Melbourne, Australia. During the extensive study and research of Georgette Heyer&#39;s work for her Ph. D thesis, Jennifer Kloester had access to Heyer&#39;s private papers and other information made available through the generosity of Georgette Heyer&#39;s son and, as a result has discovered a wealth of new material on a person who is known to be an immensely private writer.From Chapter 1 <p>The true Regency lasted only nine years. It began on 5 February 1811 when George, Prince of Wales, was officially sworn in as Regent and ended on 31 January 1820 when he was proclaimed King George IV. Yet the term 'Regency' is frequently used to describe the period of English history between the years 1780 and 1830, because the society and culture during these years were undeniably marked by the influence of the man who would become George IV. With the final years of the Napoleonic Wars and the enormous impact of industrialisation the Regency was an era of change and unrest as well as one of glittering social occasions, celebrations and extraordinary achievement in art and literature. Artists such as Thomas Lawrence, John Constable and Joseph Turner created iconic paintings which today constitute a tangible record of some of the people and places of the period, while many of England's greatest writers produced some of their most enduring works during the Regency. The writings of Jane Austen, Walter Scott, John Keats, Mary Shelley, Samuel Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley continue to stand as a testament to the romance, colour and vitality of the times. In many ways the Regency period was also a reflection of the character and personality of the Prince Regent himself who was one of the most flamboyant and cultured of all English monarchs. His passion for art, architecture, music, literature and hedonistic living set the tone for the era and caused his Regency to be for ever linked with the high-living, mayfly class that was the <i>ton.</i> </p><p>The Regency world was highly structured and the conventions attached to Regency life were so numerous and intricate that usually only those born and bred into upper-class circles knew and understood them. Above all, it was intensely class-conscious: the <i>ton </i>(from the French phrase <i>le bon ton</i>, meaning 'in the fashionable mode' and also known as Polite Society or the Upper Ten Thousand) lived a privileged, self-indulgent life; birth and family were vital to social acceptance, and social behaviour was determined by a complex set of rules of varying flexibility, with different codes of behaviour for men and women. It was an era of manners, fashion and propriety, and yet, for the upper class, it was also a time of extraordinary excess, extravagance and indulgence. By contrast the middle class was more interested in morality than manners and often found it difficult to follow the distinctive behaviour of the upper class. </p><p>The Social Ladder </p><p>During the Regency the social ladder had a fixed, inflexible hierarchy within the nobility and an almost equally rigid class structure within the rest of the population: </p><p>Monarch<br> Royalty<br> Aristocracy<br> Gentry<br> Middle Classes<br> Artisans and Tradespeople<br> Servants<br> Labouring Poor<br> Paupers </p><p>Class was defined primarily by birth, title, wealth, property and occupation, and there were many distinctions-some subtle, others obvious-within each level of society. While visiting his country seat of Stanyon in <i>The Quiet Gentleman</i>, Gervase Frant, seventh Earl of St Erth, met his near neighbour, Sir Thomas Bolderwood, and was at first unsure of this jovial gentleman's exact social standing. Although Sir Thomas's countenance, wealth, title, home and family all indicated good breeding, his manners lacked polish and there was a certain rough quality in his speech, the result-as he informed the Earl-of having spent most of his life in India. Discerning one's own place on the broader social scale was not all that difficult but knowing the exact position in relation to someone else of the same class was not always easy; although Mrs Bagshot in <i>Friday's Child </i>was in no doubt about the sudden (and infuriating) elevation in her young cousin Hero's social status after Hero's unexpected marriage to a peer. Ancestry was key, as were property and money (most obviously shown by the number of servants and carriages one had), although wealth became a less reliable guide to a person's breeding after industrialisation and the expansion of the Empire. Acceptance into the <i>ton </i>was often a question of degree, as discovered by the villainous Sir Montagu Revesby in <i>Friday's Child </i>when his elegant air and address were enough to see him admitted into some fashionable circles but he was still excluded by many of those at the heart of the <i>ton </i>who considered him 'a commoner'. During the Regency, the advent of the new rich-those industrialists, financiers, merchants, manufacturers, bankers, nabobs and even admirals of the fleet who had garnered enough wealth to buy their way into the upper echelons of society-created a new complication for the class-conscious aristocrat. An heiress was always an attractive prize but marriage between a member of the peerage and a female whose parents 'smelled of shop' had to be very carefully considered before any commitment was made. A scion of a noble house might find himself cut off from his inheritance if he persisted in marrying into a much lower social class, as Lord Darracott's son, Hugh, discovered after he married a weaver's daughter in <i>The Unknown Ajax</i>. </p><p>Members of the aristocracy and the gentry might be different in birth and title but between them they <i>were </i>the ruling class. A well-bred country squire of ancient lineage but with no more than a baronetcy or a knighthood to his name, if that, might meet a duke or an earl on equal terms (particularly if he was a neighbour) and show him deference only on formal occasions. In <i>Sylvester</i>, Squire Orde met the Duke of Salford on his home ground and, while being perfectly polite, did not hesitate to speak his mind or censure the Duke's actions. During the Regency the nobility was made up of members of the royal family, peers above the rank of baronet and their families, statesmen and the prelates of the Church of England such as the more powerful bishops and the Archbishop of Canterbury (who took precedence over all ranks after the royal family). The gentry included baronets, knights, country landowners (often incredibly wealthy) and gentlemen of property and good birth but no title. Robert Beaumaris of <i>Arabella </i>was plain Mister but his family's ancient lineage (his cousin was a duke and his grandmother the Dowager Duchess), his fortune, breeding and address amply compensated for his lack of title and made him one of the most eligible bachelors in England. Apart from manners and breeding, one of the main distinguishing factors between the upper class and the upper levels of the middle class was the need for the latter to actually <i>earn </i>their living. </p><p>The middle class was growing fast in Regency England as increasing numbers of financiers, merchants and industrialists were added to the wealthy doctors, lawyers, engineers, higher clergy and farmers who, among others, comprised the upper ranks of the class. To be in the middle ranks of society usually meant ownership of some kind of property-land, livestock or tools-and the ability to earn a regular and reliable income. The number of servants employed in a house and the type of carriage(s) and number of horses one owned were also useful class indicators, although some among the new middle class, such as the affluent merchant Jonathan Chawleigh in <i>A Civil Contract</i>, tended to mistake opulence for elegance and an excess of food or finery as a sign of wealth and status. But the middle class was a very large and diverse group and it also included shopkeepers, teachers, builders, the lesser clergy, members of the government administration, clerks, innkeepers and even some of the servant class. Property was really the main factor that separated the lowest level of the middle class from the better off among the labouring poor.</p></p><h2>Full Moon</h2><p>Despite marriage to a millionaire&#x2019;s daughter and success as a vice-president of Donaldson&#x2019;s Inc., manufacturers of the world-famous Donaldson&#x2019;s Dog-Joy, Freddie Threepwood, Lord Emsworth&#x2019;s younger son, still goes in fear of his aunts when at Blandings Castle. Full Moon tells the story of how he faces them down while promoting the love of Bill Lister and Prudence Garland. <p>A charming Blandings comedy with a full Wodehouse complement of aunts, pigs, millionaires, colonels, imposters and dotty earls.</p></p><p>A Blandings novel <p>When the moon is full at Blandings, strange things happen: among them the painting of a portrait of The Empress, twice in succession winner in the Fat Pigs Class at the Shropshire Agricultural Show. What better choice of artist, in Lord Emsworth&#x2019;s opinion, than Landseer. The renowned painter of The Stag at Bay may have been dead for decades, but that doesn&#x2019;t prevent Galahad Threepwood from introducing him to the castle &#x2013; or rather introducing Bill Lister, Gally&#x2019;s godson, so desperately in love with Prudence that he&#x2019;s determined to enter Blandings in yet another imposture. Add a gaggle of fearsome aunts, uncles and millionaires, mix in Freddie Threepwood, Beach the Butler and the gardener McAllister, and the moon is full indeed.</p><b>P. G.

It follows an identical format to the popular first <i>Portland Collection</i> tune book, but the music in Volume 2 is completely different from that of the first book. As with Volume 1, national standards and local favorites are included. <p>The music in <i>The Portland Collection, Volume 2</i> derives from New England, Irish, Scottish, Quebecois, Appalachian, and English sources, all of which are included in the book. Chord suggestions are provided. There is an extensive commentary on each tune. Discography, bibliography, indices, and more are included. Since the publication of <i>The Portland Collection (1)</i> in 1997, these two tune books have become the standard for contra dance musicians all across the United States and are also popular among musicians of many other genres. The books are praised for their clear, readable formats; their sturdy covers and bindings; their informative, entertaining commentaries; and especially for the repertoire itself. The music in <i>The Portland Collection, Volume 2</i>is suitable for any acoustic instrument. Beginners and accomplished musicians alike will find tunes that match their skill levels in this book. </p><p>There are two companion recordings for this book. On <i>A Portland Selection 2: Contra Dance Music in the Pacific Northwest</i> editors Susan Songer and Clyde Curley, joined by fiddler George Penk, play a representative cross section of the music in the book using a variety of tempos, harmonies, and other variations on the music. <i>A Portland Play Along Selection </i> is a 2-disc album of 97 tunes from both of the Portland Collection books engineered for ease of playing along. Fiddler Betsy Branch joins Clyde and Susan on this recording. Both of these recordings are for sale elsewhere on Amazon.com.</p></p><p>Susan Songer, of Portland Oregon, has enjoyed music as long as she can remember. In grade school, she played piano and eagerly participated in square dancing during P.E. classes. She played folk songs on guitar with informal groups during and just after college. Susan has been an avid contra dancer since 1986, and a dance pianist and fiddler since 1992. She is a member of the Portland-based contra dance bands Joyride and Calico, and also plays piano (both contra and English) coast to coast for many other fiddlers and their bands. She has tutored both beginning fiddlers and piano players at The Festival of American Fiddle Tunes and also plays contra dance week end and week-long camps. Susan is founder and director of the 75-member Portland Megaband, which plays for a very large, special dance once a year. In her other life, Susan has been first a middle school teacher and then a psychologist with a private practice. Music eventually overtook these more traditional day jobs, and she retired from psychology in order to focus on contra dance music publication and playing. <p>Clyde Curley got his first guitar in 1959 when he was in 9th grade. He has been playing folk music ever since on an increasing arsenal of instruments. Seeing Doc Watson at a San Francisco State folk festival and hearing the records of the New Lost City Ramblers in the 60 s were serious formative moments. He moved to Oregon in 1970 to begin a 31-year career teaching high school English and raise a family and to play in a variety of bands specializing in several musical styles. Clyde has extensive experience as a musician and teacher at contra dance camps and music festivals up and down the West Coast. In Portland he played mandolin and banjo with the contra dance band Jigsaw and appeared on several recordings. Now in retirement from teaching, he lives in Bellingham, Washington, where he continues to play for dances and plumb the secrets of old-time fiddling. Clyde also writes occasional articles for Strings magazine and is currently teaching himself to write fiction by hacking away at a murder mystery set in Portland.</p></p><h2>Summer at the Garden Cafe: A Novel (Finfarran Peninsula, 2)</h2><p><p>The second in Felicity Hayes-McCoy's Finfarran Peninsula series, and sequel to <em>The Library at the Edge of the World</em>&#x2014;a heartwarming story about secrets between four generations of Irish women, and the healing powers of books, love, and friendship.</p><p>The Garden Caf�, next to Lissbeg library, is a place where plans are formed and secrets shared, and where, even in high tourist season, people are never too busy to stop for a sandwich and a cup of tea.&nbsp; </p><p>But twenty-one-year-old Jazz&#x2014;daughter of the town&#x2019;s librarian Hanna Casey&#x2014;has a secret she can&#x2019;t share.

But he insists on writing out his statement in longhand. In the forty-eight hours that follow, the stranger confesses to not just a crime but an entire life�spinning a wry and haunting tale of youth and adulthood, of obsession and revenge, and of two men's intertwined lives. </p> <p> Fiendishly clever and darkly funny, <i>Land of the Blind</i> speaks to the bonds and compromises we make as children�and to the fatal errors we can make at any time. </p></p><p>Jess Walter, a reporter whose first novel fictionalized the true crime story of a serial killer in Spokane, Washington, (<i>Over Tumbled Graves</i>) has penned a riveting, elegiac thriller about a middle-aged man who wants Spokane police detective Caroline Mabry to witness his confession to a crime that hasn't yet been discovered. As Clark Mason writes the long story of a childhood friendship gone horribly wrong, readers will shudder, remembering their own tortured adolescence and revisiting it in that of Eli Boyle, whose physical and social awkwardness made him a natural target for his peers. Back then, even Clark joined the crowd in making fun of Eli. But he also showed him some kindness--enough to make Eli agree to let Clark turn his fantasy game, Empire, into a high-tech start-up years later, and to bankroll Clark's run for Congress. But when the technology boom goes bust and Clark's dreams run out of steam, Eli makes a last, frightening bid for what he's always wanted--revenge on those who made his childhood hell, including the woman Clark has loved since high school. Walter's abilities as a prose stylist and his sense of narrative tension shine through in this extremely well written novel, which is far stronger than his first, but shares its deep sense of time and place. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p>Jess Walter is the author of six novels, including the bestsellers <em>Beautiful Ruins</em> and <em>The Financial Lives of the Poets</em>, the National Book Award finalist <em>The Zero</em>, and <em>Citizen Vince</em>, the winner of the Edgar Award for best novel.

Liberalism seems to demand a follow-up question: &#x201c;Who am I to judge?&#x201d; Peaceful coexistence, in this view, is predicated on restraint from morally evaluating our peers. But Rahel Jaeggi sees the situation differently. Criticizing is not only valid but also useful, she argues. Moral judgment is no error; the error lies in how we go about judging.</p><p>One way to judge is external, based on universal standards derived from ideas about God or human nature. The other is internal, relying on standards peculiar to a given society. Both approaches have serious flaws and detractors. In <i>Critique of Forms of Life, </i>Jaeggi offers a third way, which she calls &#x201c;immanent&#x201d; critique. Inspired by Hegelian social philosophy and engaged with Anglo-American theorists such as John Dewey, Michael Walzer, and Alasdair MacIntyre, immanent critique begins with the recognition that ways of life are inherently normative because they assert their own goodness and rightness. They also have a consistent purpose: to solve basic social problems and advance social goods, most of which are common across cultures. Jaeggi argues that we can judge the validity of a society&#x2019;s moral claims by evaluating how well the society adapts to crisis&#x2015;whether it is able to overcome contradictions that arise from within and continue to fulfill its purpose.</p><p>Jaeggi enlivens her ideas through concrete, contemporary examples. Against both relativistic and absolutist accounts, she shows that rational social critique is possible.</p></p><p><p>Rahel Jaeggi is Professor of Social and Political Philosophy and Director of the Center for Humanities and Social Change at the Humboldt University of Berlin.</p>&#x201c;<i>Critique of Forms of Life</i> is a comprehensive work that convincingly sets out the philosophical kernel of Hegel&#x2019;s view, reconstructing and updating it in such a way that it becomes a &#x2018;live&#x2019; philosophical option for contemporary audiences. Jaeggi is a rare instance of a philosopher who is immersed in both Continental and Anglo-American philosophical traditions and skillfully unites them in one dialogue.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Fred Neuhouser, Barnard College, Columbia University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Jaeggi combines...phenomenological attention to lived experience and an eye for social detail... She binds that together with a shrewd grasp of critical theory and the philosophical landscape of the present. Her footnotes alone would make a good book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Terry Pinkard</b><b>, </b><b><i>European Journal of Philosophy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Jaeggi offers an interesting new attempt to fulfill the task Habermas has set for critical theory. She recommends accepting the plurality of life forms... Nevertheless we can still uphold a general ideal of emancipation and judge the different contributions of different life forms to a more rational world, if we consider the abilities of life forms to learn from crises and to transform themselves accordingly.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andreas Niederberger and Tobias Weihrauch</b><b>, </b><b><i>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Jaeggi has already earned a firm place in German philosophy. This book reinforces the impression that she has established an important philosophical voice that addresses society and its problems and that we will hear from in the future, even beyond the academy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eva Weber-Guskar</b><b>, </b><b><i>S�ddeutsche Zeitung</i></b></p><h2>Mindsight: Near-Death and Out-of-Body Experiences in the Blind</h2><p>This book investigates the astonishing claim that blind persons, including those blind from birth, can actually &#34;see&#34; during near-death or out-of-body episodes. The authors present their findings in scrupulous detail, investigating case histories of blind persons who have actually reported visual experiences under these conditions.There is fascinating evidence that the blind do &#34;see&#34; in these moments, but it is not sight as we think of it. Ring and Cooper suggest a kind of &#34;transcendental awareness&#34; they refer to as Mindsight. It involves seeing in detail, sometimes from all angles at once, with everything in focus, and a sense of &#34;knowing&#34; the subject, not just visually, but with multisensory knowledge.Human beings may be more talented than we think, gifted with amazing abilities of perception.

Trisha and her cousins can hardly wait to see one another again. They can&#39;t decide what they like best: the great feast (with zillions of meatloafs and gazillions of Jell-O salads), the softball game, the storytelling . . . the yearly rituals go on and on. But this year, Gramma has a new surprise in store: She promises to teach the grandchildren to catch lightning in a jar. Lightning in a jar! Trisha can&#39;t wait to find out what she means. It&#39;s a secret she will pass down to her own grandchildren one day, along with the family stories handed down with love through all the generations.</p><p>Illustrator-author Patricia Polacco returns to Norman Rockwell-era Michigan for another autobiographical meditation, this time on the importance of passing "the lightning of our stories and our heritage into the jars of our children's minds."<p> A fondly remembered family reunion provides the sweeter-than-sweet backdrop for this picture book, as Polacco recalls how she and her cousins eagerly anticipated her Gramma helping them "catch lightning in a jar." The "lightning," of course, eventually comes thanks to some incarcerated insects, but is warmly preceded by all sorts of metaphorical strikes and flashes: Auntie Bertha's trademark meatloaf cooked with a hard-boiled egg in the middle ("like a giant eye"), watermelon-seed-spitting and croquet games (interrupted by "friendly quarrels about bent hoops, crooked wickets and wanting to take reshots"), and, most importantly, oh-so-many stories about an umbrella-loving rattlesnake, a seven-mile walk to a one-room schoolhouse, and a grandfather who "saved souls as a circuit preacher when he wasn't farming."</p><p> Polacco's nostalgic pencil and watercolor illustrations chronicle the day's frolics, all the way up to its buggy climax. She then leaves the Greatest Generation behind for an instructive final act, about a new reunion and "a new crop of children": "I'll send them home with full bellies, tired bones and flickering jars in their laps. Their hearts will be overflowing. Full of lightning, put there by folks who loved them even before they were born." (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>"I was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1944. Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.<p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years. I have always like hearing stories from these folks. My genuine curiosity for the wonder of living a very long life prepared me to accept the declining years of my own parents.</p><p>"To get back to the farm in Union City...this place was so magical to me that I have never forgotten it! This was the place where I heard such wonderful stories told...this was the place that a real meteor fell into our font yard...that very meteorite is now our family headstone in the graveyard here in Union City.</p><p>"Did I tell you that I now live in Union City? This is after living in Oakland, California for almost 37 years. But, you see, every year I'd come back to Michigan to see my Dad and family.</p><p>"Anyway...</p><p>"In 1949 we left the farm to move, first to Coral Gables, Florida. I lived there with my Mom and my brother, Richard, for almost 3 years. Then we moved to Oakland, California. I remained there for most of my young life on into my adulthood. We lived on Ocean View Drive in the Rockridge District. What I loved the most about this neighborhood is that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike.</p><p>"It is on Ocean View that I met my best friend, Stewart Grinnell Washington. We are best friends to this day! He has a younger brother, Winston and three sisters; Jackie, Terry and Robin. When I was a student in elementary school I wasn't a very good student. I had a terrible time with reading and math. As a matter of fact, I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber. When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school. Of course, now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact, most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! Once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well.</p><p>"I went on to University, majored in Fine Art, then went on to do a graduate degree and even ended up with a Ph.D. in Art History. For a time I restored ancient pieces of art for museums. I eventually became the mother of two children, Steven and Traci, and devoted much of my days to their education and upbringing.</p><p>"I did not start writing children's books until I was 41 years old. Mind you the "art" has always been there for me most of my life. Apparently one of the symptoms of my disability in academics is the ability of draw very, very well. So drawing, painting and sculpture has always been a part of my life even before I started illustrating my books. The books were quite a surprise, really. Mind you, I came from a family of incredible storytellers. My mother's people were from the Ukraine and Russia...my father's people were from Ireland.

All rights reserved.<br>"I was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1944. Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.</p><p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years. I have always like hearing stories from these folks. My genuine curiosity for the wonder of living a very long life prepared me to accept the declining years of my own parents.</p><p>"To get back to the farm in Union City...this place was so magical to me that I have never forgotten it! This was the place where I heard such wonderful stories told...this was the place that a real meteor fell into our font yard...that very meteorite is now our family headstone in the graveyard here in Union City.</p><p>"Did I tell you that I now live in Union City? This is after living in Oakland, California for almost 37 years. But, you see, every year I'd come back to Michigan to see my Dad and family.</p><p>"Anyway...</p><p>"In 1949 we left the farm to move, first to Coral Gables, Florida. I lived there with my Mom and my brother, Richard, for almost 3 years. Then we moved to Oakland, California. I remained there for most of my young life on into my adulthood. We lived on Ocean View Drive in the Rockridge District. What I loved the most about this neighborhood is that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike.</p><p>"It is on Ocean View that I met my best friend, Stewart Grinnell Washington. We are best friends to this day! He has a younger brother, Winston and three sisters; Jackie, Terry and Robin. When I was a student in elementary school I wasn't a very good student. I had a terrible time with reading and math. As a matter of fact, I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber. When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school. Of course, now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact, most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! Once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well.</p><p>"I went on to University, majored in Fine Art, then went on to do a graduate degree and even ended up with a Ph.D. in Art History. For a time I restored ancient pieces of art for museums. I eventually became the mother of two children, Steven and Traci, and devoted much of my days to their education and upbringing.</p><p>"I did not start writing children's books until I was 41 years old. Mind you the "art" has always been there for me most of my life. Apparently one of the symptoms of my disability in academics is the ability of draw very, very well. So drawing, painting and sculpture has always been a part of my life even before I started illustrating my books. The books were quite a surprise, really. Mind you, I came from a family of incredible storytellers. My mother's people were from the Ukraine and Russia...my father's people were from Ireland. My extended family,(Stewart's family) were from the bayous of Louisiana...also great story tellers.

In this book Liz Theoharis examines both the biblical text and the lived reality of the poor to show how that passage is taken out of context, distorted, and politicized to justify theories about the inevitability of inequality.<br><br> Theoharis reinterprets "the poor you will always have with you" to show that it is actually one of the strongest biblical mandates to end poverty. She documents stories of poor people themselves organizing to improve their lot and illuminates the implications for the church. Poverty is not inevitable, Theoharis argues. It is a systemic sin, and all Christians have a responsibility to partner with the poor to end poverty once and for all.</p><p><b>Liz Theoharis</b>&nbsp;is founder and codirector of the Kairos Center for Religions, Rights, and Social Justice and coordinator of the Poverty Initiative at Union Theological Seminary. An ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church (USA), Theoharis has spent the last two decades organizing among the poor in the United States and worldwide.<b>Sr. Simone Campbell, SSS</b><br> &#x2014; NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice<br> "Be ready to be stirred up by this scriptural exploration of the meaning of poverty.

This is a book of lived theology and radical compassion."<br><br><b>Karenna Gore</b><br> &#x2014; Center for Earth Ethics, Union Theological Seminary<br> "Theoharis brings the Bible to life in this exciting study of one of its most famous passages. With a combination of rigorous theological scholarship and personal stories from her life as an organizer, she shows us that the front line in the fight against poverty is not in poor neighborhoods but rather within the assumptions of a society that fosters systemic injustice."<br><br><b>William J. Barber II</b>&nbsp;(from the foreword)<br> &#x2014; President, North Carolina NAACP<br> "The contemporary church has become so accommodative to capitalism that its theology is often viewed as a justification of economic injustice.

Bookseller Andy Laties wrote the first edition of Rebel Bookseller six years ago, hoping it would spark a movement. Now, with this second edition, Laties&#x2019;s book can be a rallying cry for everyone who wants to better understand how the rise of the big bookstore chains led irrevocably to their decline, and how even in the face of electronic readers from three of America&#x2019;s largest and most successful companies&#x2014;Apple, Amazon, and Google&#x2014;the movement to support locally owned independent stores, especially bookstores, is on the rise. From the mid-1980s to the present, Andy Laties has been an independent bookseller, starting out in Chicago, teaching along the way at the American Booksellers Association, and finally running the bookshop at the Eric Carle Museum in Amherst, Massachusetts. His innovations were adapted by Barnes &amp; Noble, Zany Brainy, and scores of independent stores. In Rebel Bookseller, Laties tells how he got started, how he kept going, and why he believes independent bookselling has a great future. He alternates his narrative with short anecdotes, interludes between the chapters that give his credo as a bookseller. Along the way, he explains the growth of the chains, and throws in a treasure trove of tips for anyone who is considering opening up a bookstore. Rebel Bookseller is a must read for those in the book biz, a testament to the ingeniousness of one man man&#x2019;s story of making a life out of his passionate commitment to books and bookselling.</p><p><b>ANDREW LATIES</b> co-founded Children&#x2019;s Bookstore, Children&#x2019;s Bookfair Company, Children&#x2019;s Museum Store, Povertyfighters.com, and Eric Carle Museum Bookshop, and Vox Pop.

Not only does Andy not go gently there, he refuses to go, period. This book is heartfelt and honest." <br>&#x2014;Bernie Rath, former executive director, American Booksellers Association<br><br>&#x201c;The local independent bookstore was long a hallmark and core contributor to the intellectual life and well-being of individuals and communities. In this modern era of "big box" bookstores, chain store booksellers, online book sellers, and digital publishing, those traditional independent bookstores are becoming an 'endangered species'. That's why Andrew Laties "Rebel Bookseller: Why Indie Bookstores Represent Everything You Want to Fight for from Free Speech to Buying Local to Building Communities" is such a timely and important contribution to our national dialogue. Now in a fully updated and significantly expanded second edition, "Rebel Bookseller" is a personal history of how Laties got into selling books, how he has survived and even prospered against book marketing factors that have proved devastating to so many others, the growth of the big chain booksellers, and more. Of special note are the wealth of anecdotes, innovations in book selling, and the cogent 'real world' advice for anyone contemplating starting up an independent bookstore of their own. Informed and informative, occasionally inspired and inspiring, "Rebel Bookseller" is very highly recommended reading.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;The revival of independent bookselling has already begun and is one of the amazing stories of our times.

He presents the country like a magic-lantern show, as vivid images ceaselessly appear before his - and his readers' - eyes. Italy's most famous sights are all to be found here - St Peter's in Rome, Naples with Vesuvius smouldering in the background, the fairytale buildings and canals of Venice - but Dickens's chronicle is not simply that of a tourist. Avoiding preconceptions and stereotypes, he portrays a nation of great contrasts: between grandiose buildings and squalid poverty, and between past and present, as he observes everyday life beside ancient monuments. Combining thrilling travelogue with piercing social commentary, Pictures from Italy is a revealing depiction of an exciting and disquieting journey. In her introduction, Kate Flint discusses nineteenth-century travel writing, and Dickens's ideas about perception, memory and Italian politics.

He died in Kent on June 9, 1870. The second of eight children of a family continually plagued by debt, the young Dickens came to know not only hunger and privation,but also the horror of the infamous debtors&#x2019; prison and the evils of child labor. A turn of fortune in the shape of a legacy brought release from the nightmare of prison and &#x201c;slave&#x201d; factories and afforded Dickens the opportunity of two years&#x2019; formal schooling at Wellington House Academy. He worked as an attorney&#x2019;s clerk and newspaper reporter until his&nbsp;<i>Sketches by Boz</i>&nbsp;(1836) and&nbsp;<i>The Pickwick Papers</i>&nbsp;(1837) brought him the amazing and instant success that was to be his for the remainder of his life. In later years, the pressure of serial writing, editorial duties, lectures, and social commitments led to his separation from Catherine Hogarth after twenty-three years of marriage. It also hastened his death at the age of fifty-eight, when he was characteristically engaged in a multitude of work.&nbsp;Public grief at his death in 1870 was considerable: he was buried in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. <br><br><b> Kate Flint </b>is Professor of English at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

But there are skeletons in her closet that may prove beyond repair...Suddenly the perils of the stock market pale in comparison to the murder, mayhem, and mystery of remodeling.</p><p>Sarah Graves lives with her husband in Eastport, Maine, where her mystery novels are set. She is currently working on her twelfth Home Repair Is Homicide novel.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br><br>Over a long, successful career of killing people for money, Walter Henderson had never before snuffed out a personal enemy. He'd made a habit of keeping his private life and his business affairs separate, and planning to break that habit now aroused a variety of new emotions in him, none of them pleasant.<br><br>Anxiety, resentment, and the kind of bone-deep reluctance a lazy schoolboy might feel, facing a pile of homework . . . these were not sentiments with which Walter Henderson, a paid assassin, had any significant experience.<br><br>Thus as he sat waiting in his comfortable leather armchair for the inevitable to occur, he tried yet again to come up with some other way out of the situation in which he found himself. But he'd been over it all a hundred times in his head already and he'd found none.<br><br>Because there weren't any. So now here he was. <i>I'm not even supposed to be doing this anymore</i>, he thought irritably. With one exception&#x2013;a loose end he meant to tie up very soon&#x2013;he'd decided that his death-dealing days were history.<br><br>But apparently resolutions really were made to be broken, he thought. Then came the sound he'd been waiting to hear: stealthy footsteps on the gravel driveway outside, not far from his open window.<br><br>Walter looked up from the book he'd been pretending to read, in the warm pool of light in the den of his large, luxuriously appointed house in Eastport, Maine. It was late. The housekeeper had gone home to her own house, and his teenaged daughter Jen was already in bed.<br><br>Or so she'd tried hard to convince him as she'd headed upstairs an hour earlier: clad in pajamas, carrying a glass of milk and a handful of cookies, and yawning elaborately.<br><br>Smiling with affection, thinking how pretty she was with her golden tan, strong athlete's body, and sun-bleached blonde hair, Walter had bid his daughter a fond good night. Then he'd built a fire in the enormous granite fireplace that formed one whole wall of the room, piling it with chunks of aged driftwood so it flamed extravagantly before settling to a fierce red glow.<br><br>After that, with a scant two fingers of Laphroaig in a chunky cut-crystal lowball glass to keep him company, he'd sat down with his book to wait. Despite the chilly spring evening the fire let him keep the window open, admitting salt air and whiffs of wood smoke along with the distant, varied hoots and moans of the foghorns on the dark water a few hundred yards distant.<br><br>Now Walter sat very still, listening to the sound of cautious movement outside, a whispery crunching on stones that someone was trying to minimize.<br><br>To no avail. That you couldn't approach the house without traversing an expanse of pea gravel was not an accident, any more than the elaborate alarm system, heat-and-motion detectors, or closed-circuit TV cameras that Walter had installed when he'd had the house built.<br><br>All turned off now, of course. Walter didn't want any record, electronic or otherwise, of what transpired here tonight. Just to be sure, he'd had an old buddy of his run up from the city a week earlier to disarm the devices, taking care to make it appear that the central controller circuits had silently malfunctioned.<br><br>In the unlikely event that anyone checked. Walter listened a while longer to be certain it wasn't only a wild animal out there, a deer or raccoon or maybe even a moose. There were plenty of them on the island where Eastport was located, seven miles off the coast of downeast Maine and another thousand or so from the neon-lit nightlife Walter Henderson was used to: pimps and hookers, loan sharks and dope addicts, pushers and grifters . . . <br><br>All in the past now, he reminded himself without regret. And from the sound of it, tonight's visitor was indeed human. A glance outside confirmed this; there was a light on in the barn, faintly illuminating a high square of window.<br><br>Which there hadn't been the last time Walter looked. He waited ten deliberate minutes, then laid his book aside, got up, and removed the loaded pistol from its usual place in the upper right-hand drawer of his desk. Placing the gun in his sweater pocket, he padded from the room, pausing in the dark hall but not bothering to go upstairs to see whether or not Jen was really asleep.<br><br>He knew she wasn't, that the yawning and milk getting and elaborate expressions of tiredness had all been an act. For the past few weeks, ever since she'd graduated and come home from the exclusive New York boarding school where she'd spent her high school years, she'd been sneaking out via those same back stairs nearly every night to meet a boy.<br><br>And not just any boy. Walter knew it was that worthless little helper the carpenters had brought with them last summer when they arrived to rebuild the barn. Which by itself was okay, bringing along a useless helper. He understood that. People had expenses to cover and sometimes they resorted to methods.<br><br>Charge high, pay low . . . it was how the world worked. Probably the contractor got a cut of the materials, too, in an arrangement with the supplier. All standard business practice and all right as rain as far as Walter was concerned, as long as nobody got too greedy.<br><br>The kid, though. The kid was something else. Because when the barn job was done and the carpenters had all gone, the kid kept coming around. Doing another kind of job now, wasn't he? On Walter Henderson's daughter.<br><br>The thought stopped him in his tracks: Jennifer. His pearl, the only person he knew of in the world who hadn't somehow been contaminated or befouled. The idea of some mangy little nobody with grimy fingernails even thinking about touching her . . <br><br>Well, but it wasn't thinkable, was it? That was the whole point. Back in the city he'd have snapped the kid's neck with his two hands, and that would've been that. Dumped him in a landfill or in the trunk of an abandoned car; if push really came to shove there was a sausage factory in Paramus that would take the kid, no problem.<br><br>But Walt couldn't do any of those things here, not without screwing up his plans for finishing off that other loose end. And now it seemed no matter what else he tried, he couldn't get rid of the kid.<br><br>Padding quietly in the plush moosehide L.L. Bean moccasins Jennifer had given him for Christmas, he slipped down the hall to the silent kitchen, past dimly gleaming appliances and the wall-mounted panel for the alarm system.<br><br>The panel's bulbs glowed green, meaning the system had been armed. But according to Walt's gadget-literate buddy, "on" commands weren't reaching the devices the system controlled.<br><br>Walt hadn't told Jen about that, though; no need. For all she knew, the alarms worked as they always had. Thinking this, he continued along the dim passageway past the utility room where a pair of Irish wolfhounds stayed when he needed them to be out of the way.<br><br>A low <i>wuff</i> came from inside the room as he went by. The dogs' nails clicked on the tiled floor as they paced uneasily, alerted by the sound of his presence. Warning growls issued from their throats.<br><br>Walter made a face. Ideally, the two expensively bred guard animals should have remained utterly silent. But he hadn't been able to stomach the severity of the aversion training required to accomplish this.<br><br>Or to make them bite, either. Yet another sign that he was getting soft, he decided. He'd retired at the right time. But not too soft to do what needed to be done this evening; dogs were one thing, snot-nosed little daughter-molesting punks quite another, he reminded himself without much effort.<br><br>Quite another, and not much effort at all; like riding a bike. "Easy, guys," he murmured to the dogs as he let himself out the back door, easing it shut behind him. He paused on the flagstone terrace overlooking Passamaquoddy Bay.<br><br>Across it the windows in the houses along the distant shoreline of Campobello Island glowed distinctly. Below them the emerald green lights nearer the water marked harbors and jetties, while to the north the white beacon of the Cherry Island light swirled slowly, strobing the night.<br><br>He stepped from the terrace to the lawn, wincing at the icy breeze. April may be the cruelest month, he thought as he made his way downhill toward the squarish dark shape of the barn outlined on an even darker moonless sky, but in Maine at night you could pretty much count on May being a mean bastard, too.<br><br>The light in the barn had gone out. Pausing, he hefted the gun in his pocket as easily as other men might handle jackhammers or drive heavy equipment; tool of the trade. When he slipped inside the barn the scent of the new wood mingled with the sweet, grassy smell of the straw bales piled in the loft.<br><br>But then came a hint of Jen's expensive perfume, faint but enough to send fresh fury coursing through him. For an instant he imagined the two of them up there, visualized them freezing together in fright at some slight sound he made.<br><br>The thud of his heart, maybe, or the grinding of his teeth. Or the hot slither of the muscles in his forearms as his fists clenched and released.<br><br>Clenched and released. The boy shriveling, Jen scrambling to cover herself . . . Walter pushed the thoughts away, smelling now the sharp reek of gasoline from the big lawn tractor in the corner. Behind it on hooks, although he could not see them, were gardening tools, the curved scythes and heavy shears, cutting and chopping implements. All with their blades freshly sharpened.<br><br>Walter moved soundlessly in the utter blackness, needing no light once his predatory instincts kicked in. He knew how to do this, and he knew his way in the dark. To his right were the loft steps and behind them an area under the loft, originally meant for open space.<br><br>But Walter's housekeeper, a habitually silent and thus thoroughly satisfactory employee he'd brought with him when he moved here from the city, had surprised him by suggesting that the area be enclosed to form an office. That way whoever Walter hired to oversee the grounds and the animals wouldn't end up tramping in and out of the main house. So a room had been built there, unused as yet and with the loft's original trap-door opening still piercing its ceiling.<br><br>Guy ever needs to escape out of his own office, he can go straight up, Walter had thought with grim humor. If he can jump that high. Unlikely, though, that the kid Walter was after tonight had gone down into the office space.<br><br>Because the jumping part was no joke; it was a good fifteen feet from the loft to the concrete floor below. And the office was locked; if you got into it from above, there was no way out.<br><br>Walter felt the tight smile vanish from his lips. <i>No way out for me, either</i>.<br><br>Or only one way. And damn it, the whole thing was really all his own fault, wasn't it? He'd been firm enough in forbidding Jen from seeing the boy, all right, just not sufficiently clear about the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>And he knew why. Raising the child by himself after her mother's death, Walter hadn't wanted Jennifer to be afraid of him. He couldn't bear seeing the knowledge arise in her eyes&#x2013;as it had in the desperate, imploring eyes of so many others&#x2013;that he was dangerous. Thus he had failed to confide in his daughter certain important details about himself.<br><br>Such as what he did for a living: that he solved problems for people. Serious problems, ones so difficult and unpleasant that they could be taken care of only by force.<br><br>But that wasn't the kind of thing you told a little girl who idolized and adored you: that her father was maybe the most respected and feared professional killer on the whole east coast. And later . . . Well, the time had just never been right.<br><br>So at the outset of this whole business, Walter had merely asked Jen if she didn't think a town kid with no money and no prospects was maybe a little beneath her.<br><br>"Oh, Daddy," she'd responded indulgently, looking up from the magazine she was reading. "What an old-fashioned way to look at things!"<br><br>Yeah, it was. He was an old-fashioned father. And his daughter's answer had told him her reaction to his comments, too: she wasn't taking the hint.<br><br>That had been in the winter when she was home for holiday break. As soon as Jen returned to school, he'd arranged to have the kid prosecuted for stalking; an easy task, since maybe the local yokels didn't know who Walter Henderson was but the state yokels certainly did. Enough of them, anyway, to get accomplished what Walter required.<br><br>The kid's public defender, a jug-eared bumpkin with a boil on his neck and dandruff on his suit, had looked appalled at the sight of Walter's expensive legal team, the courtroom equivalent of a tank full of piranhas. Jennifer had come home for only a single day to testify, and despite her furious resentment she'd said exactly what he told her to say.<br><br>Or else. He'd been clear enough about that. And even if she didn't know the nature of his employment, she knew he controlled the purse strings: her tuition, pocket money, clothing allowance, car, all the rest. She was a smart girl, his Jennifer.<br><br>Just not quite smart enough.<br><br>The verdict, predictably, had been guilty. Disposition: the defendant was out on bail until the sentencing hearing.<br><br>Which, Walter recalled as he stood very still on the barn's main floor, was tomorrow. But his pending court date apparently hadn't deterred the kid in the slightest.<br><br>Walter turned slowly in a half circle, feeling the concrete beneath his moccasins, sensing the bulk of the timber-constructed loft in the shadows above. Silence. Except for . . . What the hell?<br><br>Suddenly he was all business, both hands on the pistol grip, feet planted like an athlete's. Gun up in a practiced stance, his eyes scanning the darkness, he swung to the left and right.<br><br>No one there, although he still had the strong impression of <i>someone</i> very near. Silent, or <i>almost</i> silent . . . <br><br><i>Calm down</i>, Walter ordered himself. Cat-footed, he eased forward, feeling his pupils dial out to take advantage of any stray gleam. But . . . nothing.<br><br>Puzzled, he moved stealthily back out to where the barn's massive rafters rose high above his head unseen. The darkness up there was cavernous. The sound he'd heard had likely been just a barn beam creaking. Or a mouse.</p><h2>Learning about Theology from the Third World</h2><p><p>With the growing awareness of cultural diversity, evangelicals are beginning to realize that "growing up into Christ in all things" (Eph. 4:15) is a corporate enterprise. Due to involvement in mission and international travel, many Westerners are beginning to realize how much they have to learn from different cultural traditions. LEARNING ABOUT THEOLOGY FROM THE THIRD WORLD is designed to introduce western Christians to discussions about theology going on in the Third World. The assumption is that western thinking about theology has not taken third world perspectives into account, and the day has come for us to bring these brothers and sisters into our conversations about Christianity. For the churches in this part of the world are rapidly becoming a significant force in the world and their leaders are becoming increasingly articulate about their faith (and about distortions the feel missionaries have introduced!). It is Dyrness' thesis that if we approach these sometimes unsettling writings as learners rather than teachers, we will find our own perspectives significantly altered. The maturity of the whole church demands this kind of inter-change. After an introductory chapter on the nature and problems of contextualization, the book gives major overviews of the theology of Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Issues are presented in such a way as to show that each area of the world has developed a unique approach to theological issues, and that each perspective has something to contribute to the development of theology. To illustrate this a final chapter discusses Christology form this cross-cultural perspective and the conclusion sketches out ways in which both western and non-western traditions may interact to enrich theology.</p></p><p>William Dyrness, after doctoral studies in Europe, was a missionary in the Philippines and most recently Dean of the School of Theology and Professor of Theology and Culture at Fuller Theological Seminary.</p><h2>Thailand&#39;s Best Street Food: The Complete Guide to Street Dining in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Other Areas</h2><p><b>For many visitors, traveling to Thailand means one thing: enjoying the delicious street food.</b> <br><br>In <i>Thailand's Best Street Food</i>, freelance writer and food blogger Chawadee Nualkhair details everything that visitors need to know to track down the most delectable dishes&#x2014;no matter where they are hidden.<br><br>Most people think Bangkok is the only place to find great Thai street food, but Nualkhair ate her way across the country and experienced incredible food stalls everywhere, from Phuket in the south to Chiang Mai in the north.

Dad says don�t do anything stupid, no stupid children I made, don�t cry it doesn�t get you anywhere, only you can get you somewhere, don�t screw up and leave me the mess to collect after. Mom says don�t swear, don�t go out with Ted so much, don�t let people think you�re filthy and fast, keep your room clean, do all your homework, make some friends who are girls. I don�t say anything and just leave, because it�s easier. Ted�s waiting for me by the 7-Eleven, sitting on the curb, holding his skateboard. I walk up to him, and he looks up and squints because he�s not wearing his glasses like he�s supposed to. I got two bucks, he says. Cigarettes? I ask. I got a better idea. He stands up and kicks off on his skateboard and rides slow so I can keep up. What�s going on? he asks me. Nothing. You going home for dinner? he says. I don�t know. You can come over if you want. Will your mom be pissed? I ask. He shrugs. He says, She�ll be having her own party. Ted�s mom�s a real bad drunk, and everyone knows it. That�s part of the reason Mom doesn�t like me hanging out with him, but it�s mostly because she doesn�t like me spending all my time with a boy. Ted�s my only friend. We were each other�s only friend in junior high, and I can�t imagine people being any nicer in high school, so we�re still going to be each other�s only friend come September. Nobody likes him because he�s quiet and dorky and not really cute and maybe looks a little too delicate. Nobody likes me because I�m boring and don�t say much and still dress like I�m ten. It�s superhot but you really can�t expect anything else here in July. I hate walking around outside in this weather because I just don�t stop sweating and the smog�s really bad, and all I really want to do is lie down. But me and Ted keep going until we get to the Trader Joe�s, and he tells me to wait, and he goes inside. He comes back with a bag of chocolate-mint UFO candies, and we sit down on the ground in the parking lot and don�t say anything, and we eat them and eat them until they begin to taste chalky and we�re so thirsty we could die. But we keep eating them until they�re all gone and we both feel like throwing up. By the time I get home, the place smells like meat and onions, and I figure Mom�s cooking steak. I go into the living room, and Dad�s there drinking a scotch and asks where I�ve been. I was out with Ted, I start to say, but before I can finish he�s yelling, Tracey! Tracey comes out of her room, and she�s wearing makeup and a tiny little T-shirt that says Hostess on it and makes her boobs look huge. There�s this guy behind her, with her, I guess, and he has black hair and black eyes and he looks sort of mean, but when he sees me he smiles. What, Dad? Tracey says, sounding all sweet for her friend. Is your friend staying for dinner? Dad asks, not looking at either of them. Yeah. Mom said it was cool, Tracey says. Dad nods. Oh, Dor, she says, like she hasn�t seen me in days. This is Matthew, she says. Matthew, this is my little sister, Doreen. Nice to meet you, Matthew says, holding out his hand, smiling, and I notice that his teeth look like a bunch of Chiclets. Hi, I say. Is that all you have to say? Tracey says, all annoyed. How are you? I say. Pretty good, he answers, and he laughs a little. My family�s not very talkative, Tracey says, and then she laughs and makes herself sound real dumb. At dinner, Tracey keeps talking, and she keeps giving me looks, like I�m supposed to ask questions and act interested, but I really don�t have anything to say. Dad�s actually speaking more than usual, and Matthew�s saying some funny things I guess, and Dad�s laughing, but he�s really mostly tired like he is all the time, and I�m pretty sure he�s on his third scotch. Mom�s smiling because she likes the boys Tracey brings home because they�re all polite. I think they�re pretty smarmy. Are you excited for high school, Doreen? Matthew asks, and I�m caught off-guard because usually nobody asks me questions, specifically. I guess, I say. Don�t be. It�s dumb, he says. Then he winks at me. I feel a little twist inside my stomach. Then I keep eating, avoiding the steak because the smell of it is making me feel sick, and Tracey keeps yammering, which is enough to make anyone nauseous. I was talking to this girl, she says, whose boyfriend goes to Cal and he said that there was a really good linguistics . . . Blah blah blah. I look up at Matthew, thinking maybe he�ll wink my way again, but he doesn�t look at me. He doesn�t look at Tracey either, though. Instead he�s staring down at his plate. His steak and potatoes and salad and bread are all separated. He reminds me of a little kid. Don�t let the food touch. I think maybe Matthew�s what Henry looks like now. Except I�m almost positive Henry doesn�t have a mouthful of Chiclets. How old are you? I ask Matthew, while Tracey�s in the middle of a sentence. Doreen, don�t interrupt like that, Mom says. Say you�re sorry, Dad says. Sorry. How old are you, I ask Matthew again. He looks right at me. Twenty-one. I don�t say anything. Henry�s twenty-four. Ten years older than me exactly. Almost to the day. He was born March second, and I was born March seventh. How old are you? Matthew asks, and I�m a little surprised. Fourteen, I say. That�s a great age to be, Matthew says. You just said high school�s dumb, I say. Dor, Tracey says, kind of laughing, like it was a silly thing I just said. You�re right. I did just say that, Matthew says. I guess I have mixed feelings on the subject. Everyone laughs a little. I don�t get it. There�s a knock. Yeah? I say. Hi, Matthew says. Can I come in? Sure, I say. I�m lying on my bed, reading the playlist on this mix tape Ted gave me last year. He opens the door and smiles, walks in and starts checking out the stuff on my walls. You�re a big Pixies fan, he says. Yeah, they�re alright, I say, even though I know they�re the best thing in the world. I like them too, he says. I watch him looking at everything, touching everything a little bit. He keeps talking to me but doesn�t face me. He just stares at my wall, my CDs, the little picture of Ted that was taken when we were in the seventh grade, which is so old now that it�s curling in at the edges. Is this your boyfriend? Matthew says, tapping it. No, he�s just a friend. We�re not going out or anything, I say. I don�t even know if Matthew�s still listening, so I just keep talking. Everyone thinks we are, though, I say. Like who? Matthew says. I guess he is listening. Everyone, I say. All the kids we go to school with, my mom . . . Don�t you tell them how it is? he asks, interrupting, and now he�s looking at me like it�s the most important question he�s ever asked anyone. No, I say. Why not? he asks. Because I don�t care, really, what any of them think, I say. He smiles really slow now and gives me a nod. That�s good, Doreen, he says. You shouldn�t care what anyone thinks. I don�t have anything else to say, but he keeps staring at me. So I just stare back and make it a game for myself&#x2039;how long can I go without blinking, and then I hear Tracey in the hallway. Matthew? she says. I�m here, he says loudly, still staring. I�m coming, he says. Then he just turns around and walks out without saying goodbye, and I shut my eyes, and they tear because they�re so dry. Tracey�s done some crazy things, I guess. She�s stayed out all night without calling. She got caught drunk at her junior prom. She says she never became a real raver because all the ravers she knows are stupid. She�s pretty stupid, though. I hear her on the phone sometimes, and I just want to rip the baby barrettes right out of her boy-haircut. She mostly kisses Mom and Dad�s ass and then talks about how she owns them to her friends. She has a lot of friends. She always has boys calling her. Always has. She just can�t wait to go to college in the fall so she can get out of the house and away from all of us. She hates me because I don�t talk. She hates Mom because she�s indifferent. She hates Dad because he�s not really nice. She really doesn�t remember Henry at all, but if he was around, I�m sure she�d hate him too. We should start a band, Ted says to me, sitting on the couch in his basement TV room, drumming the coffee table. I don�t know how to play anything, I say. Doesn�t matter, he says. We can learn. What should I play? I ask. Bass, he says. The best bands in the world have female bassists, he says. I get to name it, I say. OK, what do you want to name it? he says. I don�t know yet, I say. We start making up a song we decide to call �Crackbabies,� but basically it�s all a joke and all we�re doing is laughing so hard our faces hurt. Then his mom buzzes down on the intercom they have built into the phone. Ted, come up here please, she says. Ted gets all tight-looking and says, Be right back. You can put on MTV if you want. Then he leaves. I don�t feel like putting on MTV because all they play is trash. I sit there with my feet on the coffee table, looking at the fake-wood walls and the brownish shag carpet that always smells a little funny. There�s this ashtray on the table that�s in the shape of a bathtub with a woman in it. Ted�s mom smokes. I think that�s strange&#x2039;the only people I see smoking are kids. We usually hang out in the basement when we�re at Ted�s, because you never know what kind of a mood his mom�s going to be in. He likes me to see his mom the least amount possible. I can understand why, because she&amp;...</p><h2>The Accidental Caregiver: How I Met, Loved, and Lost Legendary Holocaust Refugee Maria Altmann</h2><p><b>The Accidental Caregiver stage production currently in development!</b> <p>When thirty-two-year-old actor Gregor Collins reluctantly interviewed for a job as a caregiver more out of a favor to a friend - he had no idea his life was about to change forever.</p> <p>Seconds into a chance meeting in 2008 with, it would turn out, a world-renowned Holocaust refugee named Maria Altmann, there was an unexplainable magic in the air - it felt as if they had already met. And Collins was suddenly thrown into a situation with which he had never before been confronted: caring for someone other than himself.</p> <p>Gregor offers us a personal and unprecedented look at Maria over the three intimate years he cared for her - her thrilling escape from the Nazis, her fight and subsequent win in the landmark Supreme Court Case to return original Gustav Klimt artwork that belonged to her family in Austria, and the extraordinary people she met along the way. But the real heart of the story transcends mere historical fact.</p> <p>Through a refreshingly raw portrayal of their unlikely and unbreakable bond, imbued with humorous, candid anecdotes about his mercurial relationship with Hollywood, Gregor takes us on a deeply emotional journey of how he opened up his heart to a 92-year-old woman in need - and in turn experienced the love he had been searching for his entire life.</p></p><p>Gregor is a writer, actor and producer living in New York. He grew up in the Washington, D.C. area and holds a BA in Media Production from Florida State University. Starting his career in Los Angeles producing reality TV, he shifted gears to acting, performing on stage, on television, and in independent feature films. His writing and acting have been featured in The Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, Publishers Weekly, Cinema Editor Magazine, and on Off and Off-Off Broadway stages across New York. The Accidental Caregiver stageplay was performed in New York at the Robert Moss Theater in 2015, and The Austrian Cultural Forum New York in 2016. Gregor travels around the world as a keynote speaker to talk about his book and his three years caring for Altmann, working often with WIZO, the Women&#39;s International Zionist Organization.<p>"Gregor provides an intimate portrayal of the Maria Altmann that only her closest friends and family were privileged to see, and that others could only imagine<strong>." -E.

Traversing some of the most treacherous waters on earth, the journey would have been a risky act for an extreme adventurer in any era; for a young woman in the conservative 1930s, it was a venture of almost unimaginable daring. Betty pulled it off, and now, 67 years later, she accomplishes an equal feat--a book of pure adventure. Bijaboji is a classic of boating literature worthy of a place beside <i>The Curve of Time</i> by Muriel Wylie Blanchet, whose coastal narrative dates from the same period.<br><br>Betty slips through quiet water by moonlight, her oars dripping with phosphorescence. She goes deer hunting with a young Native man near Sechelt. She travels with a boat full of exuberant Boy Scouts for a few days and she visits lightkeepers, loggers, fishermen, doctors, missionaries and other coast dwellers who live in beautiful, isolated places and who speak openly about their lives, loves and politics. She also braves storms, rapids and blistering heat. In Douglas Channel Bijaboji capsizes and Betty loses her oars<br>and everything she owns, except her boat and her sleeping bag. She is trapped on a precarious rock ledge for three harrowing days until rescued by Native fishermen.<br><br>Through it all, she copes with her growing celebrity as people all along the coast watch for her, at the same time as they wait for news on the abdication of Edward VIII and on the disappearance of another female adventurer, Amelia Earhart. This is an amazing account written by a smart, strong, funny, independent woman with a glad heart and an abiding love of the BC coast.</p><p><b>Betty Lowman Carey</b> followed her passion for adventure into such diverse occupations as newspaper reporter, magazine feature writer, lifesaving instructor, teacher and commercial fisherman. Betty and Neil Carey have been married 62 years and live in Sandspit, BC.<br><br>Betty Lowman Carey and Neil Carey have been married 62 years and live in Sandspit, BC.<b>Pat Burkette</b><br>Special to Times Colonist<br>October 24, 2004<br><br>In the summer of 1937, ships and planes searched for aviatrix Amelia Earhart, lost in the Pacific while attempting the first round-the-world flight by a woman. But along B.C.'s Inside Passage, West Coasters kept a sharp lookout for the girl in the red canoe.<br><br>The girl, who had dipped her oars in the waters off Guemes Island, Wash., on June 18, with the intent of rowing to Ketchikan, Alaska, was 22-year-old Anacortes resident Beatrice Annette Lowman, called Betty for short.<br><br>The red canoe was <i>Bijaboji</i> (pronounced beejabogee), a cedar dugout. Betty's father, Ray Lowman, gave it to her on her 18th birthday, saying "Now it is yours, and it is a masterpiece of workmanship. It is like a Grand Banks dory, perfect for survival on the open sea. Be sure that your seamanship takes nothing away from the seaworthiness of this native canoe."<br><br>Betty, the Lowman's eldest child, named the canoe using the first two letters of her brothers' names -- Bill, Jack, Bob and Jimmy. The newly released book <i>Bijaboji, North to Alaska by Oar</i> (Harbour Publishing, $34.95) tells the page-turning story of Lowman's 1937 journey. <br><br>Betty Lowman has been Betty Lowman Carey for 62 years. She lives in Sandspit with her husband, Neil Carey. Over the phone, 82-year-old Neil explains that Betty was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease a couple of years ago, and it affects some of her memory, so he'll do the talking for both of them.<br><br>As editor of <i>Bijaboji</i>, Neil put together Betty's writings about her trip, including published articles and columns. Betty graduated from the University of Washington with a journalism degree, and worked as a newspaper reporter and magazine feature writer. Why did they wait so long?<br><br>"I met Betty in 1940, and all this time, she's kept saying I'm going to write a book about that trip," says Neil. "But every day of life was so much pleasure we didn't get down to it. With Betty turning 90 the last day of July this year, I thought, by golly we better do it."<br><br>Betty might have put off the book about the trip, but the trip itself was something she felt she had to complete. Ray Lowman forbade Betty's journey, saying it was too dangerous.<br><br>"Seventy years ago, there was a limit to what girls could do," explains Neil.<br><br>Betty invited a university friend, Florence Steele, to come along once her father had left for the Alaskan canneries in his boat, <i>Una Mae</i>. Flo, worried about the smallpox epidemic that had devastated the coast decades before, got a vaccination. By the time they reached Garden Bay in Pender Harbour, with Betty doing all the rowing, Flo, ill from the shot, decided to go back home. Betty was then about 240 kilometres from home with 1,100 or more kilometres to go. Alone at sea, she was in her element, rowing day and night, working tides and weather, singing ditties like Greig's My Mind is Like a Peak Snow-Crowned, and sleeping in the rough on bits of beach or a pile of drift logs.<br><br>"There were millions of stars overhead and a familiar constellation or two," she writes of a night row to Cortes Island. "I was alone, ecstatic, free of self-consciousness about my muscular 160 pounds, free of know-it-alls trying to tell me what equipment I would have bought for the trip if I weren't crazy. If I weren't so broke and loving it!" Betty's sparse gear included sleeping bag, cooking kit, horsehide gloves to prevent blisters, hunting knife and waterproof container of matches. She had no compass, watch or money.<br><br>She quickly found her niche in a water world "where material possessions counted for nothing if you did not have brains, strength and ability." Not to mention determination.<br><br>"Every other white person I knew of who had gone north in a hand-propelled craft had taken a steamer across the strait from Alert Bay," she writes of her intention to row across wind-swept Queen Charlotte Strait. "Afterward, all said they could have rowed or paddled across. I wanted to do it. Not to wish I had."<br><br>In isolated homesteads and settlements along the coast, she met like-minded pioneering people, who recognized her as one of their own.<br><br>Betty was fed the favoured breakfast of bacon and eggs, sent on her way with huge sack lunches, offered baths, given bunks in tugboats, fishing trollers and cabins, and taken on side-trips.<br><br><i>Bijaboji</i> is a trip through B.C.'s history. Some of the places Betty visited have gone, and some remain. Early in the journey, Betty and Flo landed on a beach on Saltspring Island. They were welcomed into a nearby farmhouse by a "smiling, hunched-over Scots lady" who served hot tea steeped over coals scraped onto the hearth.<br><br>"The lady would have been Aunty Madge," says Saltspring's Dan Caldwell instantly. His family still owns Walker's Hook, where the beach is located. Old apple and plum trees still stand, but only a few remnants of that farmhouse remain. "Her name was Margaret Sinclair Caldwell, and she was actually Irish, but she was a Glasgow-trained nurse," says Caldwell. "She died in 1940, when she was 80. She was a midwife and set off walking through the woods to attend a birth. She never made it."<br><br>But Betty's tales of thriving coastal resource-based industry, the canneries, logging camps and trollers along the Inside Passage, speak of bygone times.<br><br>And could anything have changed as much from then to now as communications? Betty called home by mail or telegraph. News came by newspaper or radio. At Sointula, Betty, herself by then the topic of newspaper articles and radio reports, listened to a broadcast about the search for a missing Amelia Earhart.<br><br>A fisherman admonished Betty. "No woman is worth it. You better hitch a ride across the strait with us or there'll be planes and cutters out looking for another dizzy dame."<br>"I did not know the famous aviatrix," writes Betty of her role model, "but felt a kinship, plus respect and admiration." Neither of the so-called "dizzy dames" -- Earhart, who was not to celebrate her 40th birthday July 24, and Betty, who turned 23 rowing <i>Bijaboji</i> on July 31, fit the 1930s feminine mould.<br><br>When a watchman tells Betty "A woman is a success when she has been loved, envied and hated," she replies, "That puts me on the failure track. Few men or women would bother to hate me because the things I enjoy and do are not explicitly feminine. None would envy me because I do not excel at the things a girl is expected to excel at and, so far as love goes, I am two weeks over 23 years old and have never been kissed in the moonlight."<br><br>Earhart, asked by the French press "Can she bake a cake?" after receiving flying awards, said, "So I accept these awards on behalf of the cake bakers and all of those other women who can do some things quite as important, if not more important than flying, as well as in the name of women flying today." Both Betty and Earhart found supportive husbands who put together books about their lives. George Palmer Putnam published Amelia's letters to him, as Last Flight.<br><br>Betty said she was not "out for a stunt." Her journey was about meeting an individual mental and physical challenge, which is at the core of all adventures. The challenge became huge when Betty swamped in Douglas Channel, losing everything but her canoe and her life.<br><br>After rescue, naysayers said Betty was crazy to go on. "I rushed out of the cabin to get hold of myself," she writes, "saying over and over in my mind that I would rather drown than arrive in Ketchikan aboard a powerboat. I'd drown myself before I'd let anybody say, 'I told you, a girl couldn't do it."<br><br>But a girl did do it. Betty Lowman rowed into Ketchikan on Aug. 19, 1937, delighting a proud father. With side trips, she'd covered 2,092 kilometres, twice what she'd planned.<br>The trip changed her life, making her a celebrity. She became a much-in-demand public speaker, travelling all over North America. Betty was 27 when she met Neil Carey, then 19 and in the U.S. Navy. She became a navy wife a year later, and the couple raised two sons, George and Gene.<br><br>If adventurous female achievement is inspirational, a torch passed from Amelia Earhart to Betty Carey also lit a fire in George, father of two girls. He realized girls were short-changed in physical education in school and started the Volleyball Club in California, which now has 10,000 girls aged 12 to 18 playing volleyball.<br><br>"Most," says Neil, "get offered college volleyball scholarships." Neil and Betty retired to the Queen Charlottes. "The isolation and beauty of the place was what attracted us. We've got enough in our heads to keep us busy. We wanted a nice quiet relaxed life."<br><br>And <i>Bijaboji</i>? In 1963, when Betty was 49, she rowed from Ketchikan to Anacortes, sometimes covering 40 miles a day. She took short trips in her canoe until 1999, when the manager of the Sandspit Airport asked if <i>Bijaboji</i> could be displayed in the air terminal for a couple of weeks. The dugout, which Betty calls "the world's best and most beautiful sea-going vessel," is still there.<br><br><i>Pat Burkette lives on Saltspring Island.</i><br>"Bijaboji has all the elements of a classic novel: a consistent story thread, suspense, a dramatic climatic point, and wonderful detail of the milieu and the characters."<br><b>&#x2014;Pat Carrie Smith, <i>Prince Rupert Daily News</i></b><br><br>"Bijaboji bubbles with energy and movement, much like the straits, channels and saltwater inlets through which [Carey] travelled..."<br><b>&#x2014;Nicole Pankratz, <i>The Vancouver Sun</i></b> <br><br>"...an informative fascinating account."<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Western Mariner</i></b></p><h2>The Prehistoric Peoples of Minnesota (Minnesota Prehistoric Archaeology Series)</h2><p>Tells the traditional stories and describes the lifeways of some of the first people of the Plains: the Pawnee, Sioux, Hidatsa, Mandan, Arikara, and Omaha Indians.

Suddenly, the United States had a million square miles of Great American Desert to administrate, an area where the resident native warriors considerably outnumbered the small U.S. Army.<br>In fact, the use of the word &#x201c;desert&#x201d; probably contributed to the idea behind using camels in the region, thanks to their reputation as &#x201c;ships of the desert.&#x201d; With that in mind, the United States Camel Corps was a military experiment in the 1850s that brought camels from Egypt and Turkey to Texas and California. The cast of characters in this story is larger than life and includes U.S. Army and Navy officers, explorers, writers, politicians, and diplomats. The most famous person involved was Jefferson Davis, a U.S. Senator from Mississippi who went on to become Secretary of War and the Confederacy&#x2019;s only president. The project also utilized Haji Ali (also known as &#x201c;Hi Jolly&#x201d;), the U.S. Army&#x2019;s first Muslim employee, and it even had a small effect on the Civil War. One of the camels, Doug, was used by the Confederates at Vicksburg, and locals despised the Red Ghost, a feral camel that terrorized rural Arizona. <br>The most important result of this historical footnote probably has no resonance in American history, and in fact, the name &#x201c;United States Camel Corps&#x201d; was never formalized, but it seems to be what historians call a retronym, a name given after a phenomenon has receded into the past. How long the name of &#x201c;Camel Corps&#x201d; has been in existence is unknown, but it has been used in literature for close to a century. What the troopers themselves called the unit remains unknown.<br>However, the unit was extraordinarily important to Mexico, thanks to a man named Elias, one of the Syrian-Arab cameleers. Hired and brought over to teach American soldiers how to handle camels, Elias eventually moved to Sonora, Mexico, married a Yaqui Mexican woman, and had a son who went on to become a formidable and energetic president of Mexico.<br>The United States Camel Corps: The History of the U.S. Army&#x2019;s Use of Camels in the Southwest during the 19th Century looks at the unique unit, from its origins to its record. Along with pictures depicting important people, places, and events, you will learn about the United States Camel Corps like never before.</p><p></p><h2>Planet News: 1961-1967 (City Lights Pocket Poets Series)</h2><p><p>Planet News collecting seven years&#x2019; Poesy scribed to 1967 begins with electronic politics disassociation &amp; messianic rhapsody TV Baby in New York, continues picaresque around the globe, elan perceptions notated at Mediterranean, Galilee &amp; Ganges till next breakthrough, comedown Poem at heart &amp; soul last days in Asia The Change 1963; tenement doldrums &amp; police-state paranoia in Manhattan then half year behind Socialist Curtain climaxed as Kral Majales May King Prague 1965, same years&#x2019; erotic gregariousness writ as Who Be Kind To for International Poetry Incarnation Albert Hall London; next trip West Coast thru center America Midwest Wichita Vortex Sutra . . . at last across Atlantic Wales Visitation promethian text recollected in emotion revised in tranquility continuing tradition of ancient Nature Language mediates between psychedelic inspiration and humane ecology &amp; integrated acid classic Unitive Vision with democratic eyeball particulars-book closes on politics to exorcise Pentagon phantoms who cover Earth with dung-colored gas.</p><p>"<em>Planet News</em> is a great book of poems.

Edgar Hoover, and above all himself.

The stream of moonlight filtering through my sheer white curtain bathed the walls in a pale yellow glow. My window shutters banged against the clapboard and then, I heard the sound again, this time with my eyes wide. I listened, my heart tapping like a steadily growing drumbeat in anticipation of some important announcement or event. After a moment I heard it once more.<br>It sounded like a cat in heat, but we had no cats. Daddy hated pets, finding them more of an obligation than a pleasure. The only animals he said had any purpose was a watchdog or a seeing-eye dog, and he had no need for either. Our house was far enough away from the downtown Provincetown area and surrounded by walls ten feet high with an entrance gate Daddy had Jerome, our grounds keeper, lock every night. Daddy also kept his shotgun under the bed, "just in case." It was, he said, a lot cheaper than feeding some mongrel, and that, he concluded, "was the bottom line."<br>This time the sound was even louder. I sat up so quickly someone would think I had springs under me, but I realized the shrill cries were not in my imagination or from nightmares. The noise was coming through the wall between my room and Belinda's. It wasn't a howl, exactly, nor was it a screech. There was something familiar about the sound and yet something starkly unusual. It was certainly not a noise Belinda would make herself, but there was no doubt it was emanating from her bedroom.<br>I stepped off my bed, scooped up my robe from the chair beside my bed, and shoved my arms into the sleeves as I left my room. Daddy and Mother had already come out of their bedroom. Mother was still in her nightgown and Daddy was in his pajamas. The dreadful sound continued.<br>"What in all hell..." Daddy started for Belinda's closed door. I followed, with Mother a distant third, but when Daddy opened the door and realized the horrendous scream came from Belinda, Mother charged forward.<br>"Winston, what's wrong?" she cried.<br>Daddy flicked on the light, illuminating the most amazing and alarming sight before us.<br>Belinda was sprawled on the floor, her nightgown bloody and crumbled up to her breasts. There, lying between her legs was a newly-born infant, the umbilical cord and afterbirth still attached.<br>Belinda's eyes were wild with terror. The baby's eyes were closed, and it jerked its tiny arm and then stopped moving.<br>"Jesus, Mary and Joseph," Daddy exclaimed under his breath, his feet hammered to the floor by astonishment.<br>Mother's eyes rolled back in her head and she folded at Daddy's feet as if her spinal cord had turned to jelly.<br>"Leonora!"<br>"Take her to bed, Daddy," I said. "I'll see to Belinda."<br>He gazed back at the sight once more to confirm it was indeed still there and not in his imagination. Then he squatted, slipped his arms under Mother and lifted her like she was a baby herself, carrying her back to their bedroom.<br>I entered Belinda's room, quickly closing the door behind me. Our servants downstairs were surely awake by now as well. Belinda whimpered. Her eyes rolled as if the room were spinning. She had her arms raised, but she was afraid to touch the infant or herself.<br>"I couldn't stop it. It just happened, Olivia," she moaned. Her whole body shook. I stepped up to her and gazed down at the bloody sight.<br>"You were pregnant? All this time you've been pregnant?" I asked incredulously.<br>"Yes," she said, gasping.<br>Now everything made sense. A number of times during the past few months Daddy and I had made comments about Belinda's gaining weight. She was ravenous at every meal lately and didn't seem at all concerned about her widening hips and bloated face. I really didn't care. It was more Daddy who complained. His precious little Barbie doll was disappearing right before his eyes and in its place grew this self-indulgent creature I called my sister.<br>Oh, once or twice, I said things like, "Aren't you afraid you'll lose your entourage of boyfriends?"<br>She didn't seem concerned even though it was true that fewer and fewer young men came around to visit her or ask her to go sailing, take walks on the beach or spend an evening in town. Now that I stared down at her squirming on the bedroom floor, her child quiet and unmoving between her thighs, I realized why she had so adamantly kept me from seeing her naked a number of times. A quick search of her closet would result in the discovery of a pair of girdles in a box. What I also understood now was her sudden and uncharacteristic interest in and desire for those baggy dresses she used to refer to as "Granny clothes" whenever I wore them.<br>I knelt beside her and put my hand on the infant's tiny chest. It felt cold already and it did not vibrate with any heartbeat, nor did it rise and fall with any breath.<br>"I don't think it's alive," I said.<br>She whimpered again.<br>"Please, Olivia, get it away. I...can't touch it," she said.<br>I didn't move quickly. I stared at the wrinkled little creature for a while, studying its facial features, its blue lips and its fingers so tiny even one of my own small fingers was the width of nearly all five of one of its hands.<br>"It was a boy," I said, more as a thought voiced aloud than anything she wanted to know.<br>Belinda closed her eyes and began to hyperventilate. I watched her suffering for a moment, still dumbfounded at how well she had kept this secret. What would our daddy think of his precious little princess now? I wondered.<br>"Do you have any idea, even an inkling of an idea, how terrible this is, Belinda? Didn't you consider this inevitable outcome and think about what it was going to do to our parents? Why didn't you come forward earlier so Daddy could have done something about this instead of deceiving everyone and hiding your condition?"<br>"I was afraid," she murmured and began to sniffle and sob. "I thought everyone would just hate me."<br>"Oh, and now we just love you?" I countered. She closed her eyes and held her breath a moment.<br>"Please, please, Olivia, help me," she begged.<br>"How many months were you pregnant?" I asked.<br>"I don't know exactly, but at least six or seven," she said quickly.<br>"That's why this child is so tiny. It's a premature birth. I knew you were having sex with some of your boyfriends, Belinda. I just knew it. I told you this would happen. I warned you. Now look, just look at what you've reaped with your wild, selfish behavior."<br>She sobbed an apology.<br>"Right," I muttered. "We'll all just blink and it will be gone."<br>"Please, Olivia..."<br>"Who is the father?" I demanded. She didn't reply. "You've got to say, Olivia. Whoever he is he bears at least half the responsibility. Daddy's going to want to know. Who is it? Arnold Miller?"<br>He was a boy she had been with a great deal more than the others.<br>"No," she said quickly. "Arnold and I never went far enough."<br>"Then who was it, Belinda? I'm not going to play a guessing game with you. Tell me! If you don't tell me, I'll leave you here wallowing in this...disaster."<br>"I don't know," she wailed. "Please, Olivia."<br>"How can you not know unless you...my God, Belinda, how many boys have you slept with? And so closely together that you can't pinpoint who would be the father of this...this child?"<br>At the moment I didn't know what bothered me more: that she had so many lovers or that I had had none.<br>She just shook her head.<br>"I don't know, Olivia. I don't know. I don't want to blame anyone. Please."<br>"You'll have to tell Daddy something, Belinda," I warned. "He won't settle for an 'I don't know.'"<br>She opened her eyes and gazed up at me, and for a moment, I thought she was going to reveal the father of her baby. Was it someone I knew well, too?<br>"Well?"<br>"I can't blame someone if I don't know for sure," she finally declared. "Can I?"<br>"They're all to blame. You might as well name all of them and let each one sweat," I said, thinking that would be a just and poetic revenge.<br>"I can't," she wailed. She shook her head so hard, I thought she would tear it off her neck.<br>"All right, suit yourself. You'll see what's going to happen now. You'll see," I predicted.<br>I rose and went to her bathroom to get some towels. Then I returned and rolled the dead infant onto one. I placed it and the afterbirth and umbilical cord on the bed just as Daddy opened the door and stepped back into the room. He looked around, his eyes avoiding Belinda for a moment. He gazed at the child before turning to me with a questioning look.<br>"He's dead, I think, Daddy," I said.<br>He nodded.<br>"Most likely," he said and approached the bed. He reached down slowly with his big hand and put the tip of his forefinger on the infant's neck. "Yes," he said. "A blessing."<br>Belinda began to wail.<br>"Stop it!" I snapped, hovering over her. "Do you want Carmelita to hear and come running up here?"<br>Belinda muffled her sobs and turned over on her side.<br>"Can you get her cleaned up and back to bed?" Daddy asked me.<br>"Yes, Daddy."<br>"Is she...bleeding or anything? Are we going to need a doctor?"<br>"I don't think so."<br>"Make sure. I'll be right back," he said.<br>"How's Mother?"<br>"I have her calmed down a bit, but she's still trembling badly," he said sorrowfully.<br>"After I get Belinda into the bathtub, I'll look in on her," I promised.<br>"Good." He hurried from the room.<br>"Get up, Belinda. I can't lift you and carry you into the bathroom. I'm going to run some water in your tub. At least cover yourself for now. You look absolutely disgusting moaning and wallowing on the floor," I said.<br>She whimpered her reply and started to brace herself on her elbows. There was blood on her legs, but she didn't look to be bleeding anymore. She took deep breaths again and sighed so deeply I thought she had passed out.<br>"Are you in any pain?"<br>"I don't need a doctor," she said. "I'll be all right."<br>"Maybe you don't need a doctor, but whether or not you'll be all right remains to be seen," I said.<br>I glanced again at the dead infant. I couldn't make out the color of its few strands of hair because its head was covered with sticky blood. There was no way to study it and determine who the father could be, I thought, and went to the bathroom to run Belinda's tub.<br>After I helped her get in, I heard Daddy return to the room. I went to the bathroom door and saw he had brought a small cardboard shoe box along. He glanced at me as he lifted the dead infant, wrapped it more tightly in the blanket, and then carefully, as if it were still alive, put it in the box.<br>"We've got to clean this up ourselves," he said, nodding at the floor. "I don't want the servants knowing anything, Olivia."<br>"I'll take care of it, Daddy."<br>"How is she?"<br>"She's all right. She'll live," I said sharply. He nodded again and lifted the box in his arms.<br>"What are you going to do, Daddy?"<br>He paused.<br>"I'll have to bury the poor thing," he said.<br>For a moment I just stood there staring at him clutching the makeshift coffin in his arms.<br>"Don't we have to report it to someone?" I asked.<br>"If we do that, Olivia, this terrible event will be headline news in every home and tavern in Provincetown. It would definitely do Belinda no good, and it would be very damaging to the family. Apparently, she did a good job of keeping all this a secret from us, but question her vigorously and make sure no one else knows about it," he added.<br>"Yes, Daddy."<br>"Don't forget. As soon as you finish with her, please look in on your mother."<br>"I will, Daddy."<br>He stared for a moment and then looked at the box in his arms.<br>"It has to be this way," he concluded, more for himself than for me, I thought. He turned and hurried out of the bedroom with the box cradled securely in his arms.<br>I returned to the tub and saw to it that Belinda washed herself. I helped her dry her body and then I brought her a new, clean nightgown. After I got her back into bed, I went downstairs to the utility room. I found I was tiptoing and slinking along in my own home, moving like a burglar to keep from waking Carmelita, our maid and cook, or Jerome. I got a pail, a mop, rags and some detergent. Then I returned to Belinda's room and filled the pail with hot water.<br>Fortunately, she had lowered herself from the bed onto a throw rug and the rug had absorbed most of the blood. I rolled up the rug and then washed away any traces of the horrendous event. Belinda lay there with her eyes closed, moaning softly, occasionally sobbing. As I worked, I rattled off a relentless series of complaints and chastisements.<br>"You've really done it this time. Mother is beside herself. Daddy looked pale enough to be a corpse, too. We'll all have nightmares forever. What did you think, it would all just go away without anyone knowing?"<br>I paused and looked down at her wilting little face.<br>"Did you think being pregnant was like having a cold or the measles? Maybe you damaged yourself forever, Belinda. Maybe now you'll never be able to have a child decently. No one will want to marry you. What were you thinking?" I ranted. How could this be happening? I wondered. How could anyone, even Belinda, do such a thing to herself and her family?<br>"Please, Olivia. Please, stop. Please," she begged putting her hands over her ears.<br>"I'll stop. I should stop and let you clean up this mess," I muttered. "Does anyone else know about your being pregnant? You didn't tell any of your bubbleheaded friends at school, did you?" I followed. Most of Belinda's friends were silly, spoiled girls I called the Bubble Gum Club because I thought their brains were full of bubbles.<br>"No, no one knows anything," she swore. "I always got dressed and undressed in private when I took physical education class, and I never showered at school."<br>"You better be telling the truth," I warned her.<br>I went to the bathroom and cleaned up the tub so Carmelita wouldn't find any traces of this tragedy.<br>Daddy returned, his dark brown hair wild, his eyes full of torment and shock. He saw the rug and the wet rags and picked everything up.<br>"I'm going to bury all this too," he mumbled. "It must be as if none of this ever happened."<br>He looked about madly.<br>"You've got everything, Daddy."<br>"Good," he said and charged out. I had never seen our father look more crazed. It actually frightened me more than it frightened Belinda, who was lying there with her eyes closed most of the time. I imagined she was afraid to look him in the face now.<br>After Daddy left again, I went to see how Mother was doing. She was sitting at the edge of her bed, working up the strength to stand and see about Belinda. She still looked quite pale, her breathing labored.<br>"Mother, you should lie down again," I said rushing to her side.<br>"How is Belinda?"<br>"She'll be all right. I got her cleaned up and back to bed."<br>"And..."<br>"Daddy's taken care of all the rest."<br>"Taken care?"<br>"The baby died right away, Mother," I said. "It was premature. Daddy took the baby and buried it someplace. He said he doesn't want anyone to know."<br>"Buried?" she gasped and shook her head. "God forgive us," she whispered.<br>I thought she would fall forward to the floor, so I seized her by the elbow and tried to get her to lie back, but she shook her head.<br>"I have to look in on her, Olivia."<br>She wobbled when she stood. I put my arm around her waist and helped her to the door. She grew stronger as she walked and returned to Belinda's bedroom.<br>Belinda started to sob as Mother approached her.<br>"I'm sorry, Mommy," she whimpered. "I'm sorry."<br>Mother sat on the bed and held her in her arms, and as Belinda cried, Mother rocked her.<br>"Poor child," she said.<br>"Poor child? She ought...</p><h2>Head First!

He was thirty-one in 1652, simply one among several outstanding clerics from the younger generation who had impressed Neronov and Vonifat'ev by their piety, force of personality, and devotion to spiritual renewal. Thirty years later he was considered a saint by many; he had become the authoritative doctrinal arbiter among the dissenters and an inspiring example of unflinching defiance no matter the risk or cost. <br> <br>In reading Avvakum's <i>Life</i> we are struck by the astonishing record of his tumultuous existence prior to his final imprisonment. Yet many of his contemporaries could have matching him tale for dramatic tale, had they his narrative gifts. Avvakum's sufferings had little to do with his special destiny. When he returned from his Siberian exile in 1664, the older leaders of the Lovers of God were scattered, discouraged, or dead. Conservatives were understandably attracted by this charismatic and already well-known spokesman for their convictions, especially as his visibility increased in proportion to his growing antipathy for the reformers and their conciliatory blandishments. When Avvakum did not bend under his second exile nor break under the excommunication and anathema heaped upon his by the Ecumenical Council of 1666-67, he was thrust into a position of lasting preeminence. His entire life seems to have been a preparation for this culminating confrontation with the devil's deputies and for his subsequent imprisonment in the arctic village of Pustozersk; it was there in bestial incarceration that he produced the writings which consolidated his place among the schismatics, in the annals of Russian history, and in the cultural consciousness of every literate Russian. <br> <br>This volume includes a preface, introduction, remarks, annotation, notes, and references by Kenneth N. Brostrom. The study of <i>Life</i> by V. V. Vinogradov is also included. Avvakum's<i>The Life of the Archpriest Avvakum</i> is translated by Kenneth N.

Drawing on phenomenology and the work of thinkers such as Frantz Fanon, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Iris Marion Young, the essays address the embodiment experiences of African Americans, Muslims, Asian Americans, Latinas, Jews, and white Americans.

Yet two million girls experience this each year. Most Westerners, upon learning of the practice of female circumcision, have responded with outrage; those committed to improving the status of women have gone beyond outrage to action by creating various programs for "eradicating" the practice. But few understand the real life complexities families face in deciding whether to follow the traditional practices or to take the risk of change.</p><p>In <i>The Female Circumcision Controversy</i>, Ellen Gruenbaum points out that Western outrage and Western efforts to stop genital mutilation often provoke a strong backlash from people in the countries where the practice is common. She looks at the validity of Western arguments against the practice. In doing so, she explores both outsider and insider perspectives on female circumcision, concentrating particularly on the complex attitudes of the individuals and groups who practice it and on indigenous efforts to end it. Gruenbaum finds that the criticisms of outsiders are frequently simplistic and fail to appreciate the diversity of cultural contexts, the complex meanings, and the conflicting responses to change.</p><p>Drawing on over five years of fieldwork in Sudan, where the most severe forms of genital surgery are common, Gruenbaum shows that the practices of female circumcision are deeply embedded in Sudanese cultural traditions&#x2014;in religious, moral, and aesthetic values, and in ideas about class, ethnicity, and gender. Her research illuminates both the resistance to and the acceptance of change. She shows that change is occurring as the result of economic and social developments, the influences of Islamic activists, the work of Sudanese health educators, and the efforts of educated African women. That does not mean that there is no role for outsiders, Gruenbaum asserts, and she offers suggestions for those who wish to help facilitate change.</p><p>By presenting specific cultural contexts and human experiences with a deep knowledge of the tremendous variation of the practice and meaning of female circumcision, Gruenbaum provides an insightful analysis of the process of changing this complex, highly debated practice.</p></p><p>Ellen Gruenbaum is Professor of Anthropology at Purdue University.<p>"This smart, systematic analysis of a practice that has multiple histories, forms, and meanings is the . . . most lucid addition to a growing body of anthropological literature. . . .

One day blond Brady and his friend Lawrence (the African-American narrator) make an early return; Lawrence is dismayed to see a tough-looking boy taking his favorite bike, signing an obviously false name. Sure enough, ``Abrehem Lincoln'' doesn't bring the bike back until the younger boys pursue him next day; and when he's entrusted with a second bike, he misuses it--but then returns to confide his true name and make an earnest effort at repair.

At its center is Ethernan, an Irish missionary to Scotland who, in the seventh century, retreated to the Caiplie Caves to consider a life as a hermit. Here, Solie inhabits the mind of a man torn between establishing a priory on May Island and an existence of solitude, his uncertainty pulling him in seemingly contradictory directions. Interwoven with the story of Ethernan are poems whose subjects orbit the physical location of the caves: the fall of a coal-fired power station; an &#x201c;old man, who raises his spirit like a lamp, / collects Stella cans tossed from the raceway&#x201d;; seabirds &#x201c;frontloaded with military tech&#x201d;; the dichotomous nature of the stinging nettle. With a singular blend of wry and mythic tones, Solie makes the seventh century feel like recent memory and contemporary issues as disjointing as the distant past. These are meditations on the crisis of time and change, on class, power, and belief. Above all, these are ambitious and exhilarating poems from one of today&#x2019;s most gifted poetic voices.</p></p><p><b>Karen Solie</b> was born in Moose Jaw and grew up in southwest Saskatchewan, Canada.

The struggle over the U.S. Constitution in 1788 pitted the Federalists, supporters of a stronger central government, against the Anti-Federalists, the champions of a more localist vision of politics. But, argues Saul Cornell, while the Federalists may have won the battle over ratification, it is the ideas of the Anti-Federalists that continue to define the soul of American politics.<br><br>While no Anti-Federalist party emerged after ratification, Anti-Federalism continued to help define the limits of legitimate dissent within the American constitutional tradition for decades. Anti-Federalist ideas also exerted an important influence on Jeffersonianism and Jacksonianism. Exploring the full range of Anti-Federalist thought, Cornell illustrates its continuing relevance in the politics of the early Republic.<br><br>A new look at the Anti-Federalists is particularly timely given the recent revival of interest in this once neglected group, notes Cornell. Now widely reprinted, Anti-Federalist writings are increasingly quoted by legal scholars and cited in Supreme Court decisions--clear proof that their authors are now counted among the ranks of America's founders.<br><br></p><p>"An extremely well-researched and well-written work."-- <i>Journal of American Studies</i> <br>Reconsiders the role that Anti-Federalists played during the debate over ratification of the Constitution and traces their political legacy in the half-century that followed.</p><h2>Intimate Kisses: The Poetry of Sexual Pleasure</h2><p>In 1997, sex therapist and marriage counselor Wendy Maltz, author of the Sexual Healing Journey and coauthor of Private Thoughts, compiled Passionate Hearts, an anthology of "poems that inspire and celebrate healthy sexual intimacy; poems in which heart connection was at the core of the sexual experience."

A codex refers to a classical work of spiritual scripture, and in that spirit, author J. E. Williams has given us a book representing Andean spiritual life that gives the tradition the respect it deserves. <br><br><i>The Andean Codex</i> recounts Williams' adventures with the Q'ero Indians, and guides readers to an understanding of Incan cosmology, Andean ethics, shamanic initiations using the mind-expanding ayahuasca and the sacred coca plant. The author's photographs enhance the book and the Earth-based, heart-centered teachings of the Q'ero foster inner discovery that makes for an authentic introduction to the Andean sacred way.</p><p>I have been in search of the "secret" of the Andes since 1970. I believe that the ancient native American civilizations attained a high level of culture, knowledge about astronomy and the natural environment, and had a spiritual tradition equal to Egypt, India, or China. After 1492, a massive disruption of life and environment occurred from European diseases, guns, and steel swords. I went on a quest to find what remained of these teachings.<br><br>In the Peruvian Andes, I found that the Q'ero preserved much of this wisdom. Between 2000 and 2004, I journeyed to Peru six times and once stayed for two months. During this time, I was exclusively with the Q'ero shaman, Sebastian, whom I introduce in <i>The Andean Codex</i>, who shared with me the fundamental principles by which they lead their lives. These principles includes <i>Ayni</i> - the way of reciprocity, along with three principles of balanced living, and <i>Kawsaypacha</i> - the world of living energy. These five principles make up the Andean Codex. They are intimately linked within a world where humans and all life interact on equal terms. I discovered that what the Q'ero embrace is exactly what modern Westerners are missing. So, I set upon a mission to convey these teachings to every one.For more than thirty years Dr. J. E. Williams has risked his health and personal safety to journey among shamans in Peru, the place he calls the mystical and spiritual center of our times. In its rain forests, mountains, and environmentally attuned indigenous population, Peru's mystical landscape fosters inner discovery.<br><br><i>The Andean Codex</i> guides the reader step by step through journeys to Andean sacred places like Machu Picchu, Cuzco, and Moray, and in the process uncovers the esoteric meaning of these ruins. Williams recounts his initiation with Peruvian shamans, including shamanic ceremonies he performed at Machu Picchu and his experiences using the mind-expanding, heart-opening ayahuasca and the sacred coca plant.<br><br>Throughout these encounters, Williams weaves in practical advice that brings the wisdom of Andean shamans to life. His unforgettable account of their prayers, practices, and ceremonies offers a rare opportunity to see the world through the eyes of a shaman and experience the Andean sacred way.</p><h2>The Making of the American Essay (A New History of the Essay)</h2><p><p>For two decades, essayist John D'Agata has been exploring the contours of the essay through a series of innovative, informative, and expansive anthologies that have become foundational texts in the study of the genre. The breakthrough first volume, <i>The Next American Essay,</i> highlighted major work from 1974 to 2003, while the second, <i>The Lost Origins of the Essay,</i> showcased the essay's ancient and international forebears. Now, with <i>The Making of the American Essay,</i> D'Agata concludes his monumental tour of this inexhaustible form, with selections ranging from Anne Bradstreet's secular prayers to Washington Irving's satires, Emily Dickinson's love letters to Kenneth Goldsmith's catalogues, Gertrude Stein's portraits to James Baldwin's and Norman Mailer's meditations on boxing.</p><p>Across the anthologies, D'Agata's introductions to each selection-intimate and brilliantly provocative throughout-serve as an extended treatise, collectively forming the backbone of the trilogy. He uncovers new stories in the American essay's past, and shows us that some of the most fiercely daring writers in the American literary canon have turned to the essay in order to produce our culture's most exhilarating art.</p><p><i>The Making of the American Essay</i> offers the essay at its most varied, unique, and imaginative best, proving that the impulse to make essays in America is as old and as original as the nation itself.</p></p><p><b>John D'Agata</b> is the author of <i>Halls of Fame</i>,<i> About a Mountain</i>, and <i>The Lifespan of a Fact. </i>He teaches creative writing at the University of Iowa, where he serves as the director of the Nonfiction Writing Program.<p>&#x201c;An ambitious project that casts far and wide for exemplary contributions to the essay as a risk-taking work of art.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;</b><b><i>Lambda Literary </i></b></p><p>&#x201c;The concluding volume of D&#x2019;Agata&#x2019;s massive trilogy of anthologies on the nonfiction form showcases a remarkable array of writers from Anne Bradstreet to Kathy Acker.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;<i>Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;I would say that out of the twenty come years I&#x2019;ve been doing this show there are few books that I&#x2019;m certain will be read well beyond the show&#x2019;s lifetime, and it&#x2019;s been an honor to be associated with them.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Michael Silverblatt, KCRW&#x2019;s <i>Bookworm</i></b> </p><p>&#x201c;D&#x2019;Agata is America&#x2019;s most intellectually eloquent reader of the essay....With this third and final volume of his long labor of love he gives us a defining work of reference that will serve generations to come.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Vivian Gornick</b> </p><p>&#x201c;John D&#x2019;Agata&#x2019;s anthologies are always stimulating, provocative and full of surprises. Moreover they invaluably extend our notion of what an essay is and can be. This third volume provides the fitting capstone to a brilliant, insanely ambitious endeavor. There are enough nourishing pieces to munch on for years to come.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Phillip Lopate</b></p><p>&#x201c;John D&#x2019;Agata has given our civilization an inexhaustible gift with his three massive compendia of the recent past, the remote past, and the ingenious present and speculative future of the essay. Monumental and intellectually and imaginatively generous, these books are not only absorbing reading but wonderful examples of how, in the right hands, the act of anthologizing becomes an art in its own right.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Vijay Seshadri</b></p><p>&#x201c;John D&#x2019;Agata&#x2019;s alternative histories of the essay are anthologies in the same way the aurora borealis is actually a bunch of charged collisions; in his books we get to see pieces of art crash against his own restless brilliance. In this third installment, he is once more a stunning curator, giving us the story of the American essay as a strange, nimble creature&#x2015;vexed and incandescent in its uncertainties, constantly surprising in its negotiations of anguish, mischief, and awe. Here we find ancient varieties of wonder and doubt provisionally fleshed in captivity tales and curiosity cabinets; we find silence and insomnia, blood and swollen moons. This American history is also a history of unknowing itself: a record of the human impulse to metabolize the world and a record of this impulse continually meeting the world&#x2019;s infinitudes.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Leslie Jamison</b></p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s clear that the past fifteen-or-so years saw a rethinking and a rebirth of the essay, and equally clear that John D&#x2019;Agata&#x2019;s work was essential in both. He pushed the form forward with one hand and extended our grasp of its roots with the other. He remains as exciting to read as to argue with, and his hunting in the worlds of lost non-fiction has shown me many new writers and texts.<i>The Making of the American Essay </i>completes a series on the subject and brings the achievement of all three books into focus. It is major.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;John Jeremiah Sullivan</b></p><p>&#x201c;Please, if the world gets blown to smithereens tomorrow, let this series be the one that tells the next civilization all that we thought and dreamt and said. John D&#x2019;Agata has done something truly remarkable here: as archivist and archaeologist, as artist and impresario of the purest literary form&#x2015;the essay&#x2015;he has left a dazzling record of, as he puts it, &#x2018;our human wondering.&#x2019; <i>A New History of the Essay</i> is learned and idiosyncratic, addictive and wildly entertaining. It belongs on every shelf.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Michael Paterniti</b></p><p>&#x201c;At last <i>The Making of the American Essay</i> completes John D&#x2019;Agata&#x2019;s anthology series, <i>A New History of the Essay. </i>Here the crucial middle years&#x2015;how we got here&#x2015;have been filled in, and we can understand anew just how the essay, our American essay, has grown and lived and been written and rewritten. This canon-making is a major undertaking and an astonishing act of literary generosity for which we all should be grateful. As D&#x2019;Agata puts it, &#x2018;The world, we all know, is already a nonfiction. Let the essay be what we make of it.&#x2019; Emphasis on the <i>make&#x2015;</i>these are the essays we have made, and of these essays we are made&#x2015;but also on the <i>we</i>. The essay may be a solo thing, but these are songs for all of us to sing.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Ander Monson</b></p><p>&#x201c;Nothing could be sweeter than another hugely ambitious and visionary gathering of essays from John D&#x2019;Agata and Graywolf. In the preceding anthologies I&#x2019;ve sat in my chair and circled the world, sought out the past, and looked into the future. Now set squarely in America, once again the essay, that most humble and solitary of forms, finds its epic account, rising out of a flood and sweeping toward a horizon of ellipses, a leaving off and a farewell that generously makes room . . . for more . . . more of our voices, more of our shapes, more of our secrets and uncertainties, more of the teeming and inventive energy inside the simplest facts . . . and more of us, reader and writer alike, because in the end this wild and wandering epic is our song to sing.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Charles D&#x2019;Ambrosio</b></p><p>&#x201c;For well over a decade now, John D&#x2019;Agata has been the renovator-in-chief of the American essay. As practitioner and theorist, writer and anthologist, as example and the enabler of examples, D&#x2019;Agata has refused to yield to the idea of non-fiction as stable, fixed, already formed. . . . Instead, he has pushed the essay to yield more of itself, to find within itself an enactment of its own etymology&#x2015;an essaying, a trying, a perpetual attempt at something (after the French verb <i>essayer</i>, to try). He has emphasized that the essay should make, and not merely take; that it should gamble with the fictive and not just trade in the real; that it should entertain uncertainty as often as it hosts opinion; that the essay can be as lyrical, as fragmented, as self-interrupting, and as self-conscious as the most experimental fiction or verse. . . . &#x2018;Let the essay be what we make of it,&#x2019; is D&#x2019;Agata&#x2019;s refrain, and his three large anthologies have made good on that promise.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;James Wood, from the foreword to <i>A New History of the Essay</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;John D&#x2019;Agata is a groundbreaking literary activist. It is due to him and these anthologies that the most exciting writing today is happening in the realm of nonfiction, in particularly the realm of the essay, which he has, near-single-handedly, rescued from the literary dustbin and turned into a vital contemporary art form. <i>A New History of the Essay</i> is essential reading for anyone interested in the future of nonfiction.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Heidi Julavits</b></p><p>&#x201c;John D&#x2019;Agata has provided a wonderful&#x2015;and useful&#x2015;map of the vast territory that is the American essay.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Lewis Hyde</b></p></p><h2>The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything</h2><p>The element is the point at which natural talent meets personal passion. It is here that people feel most themselves, inspired and able to achieve at their highest levels. In this ground-breaking book, world renowned creativity expert Ken Robinson identifies a crisis in education and business: whether it&#39;s a child bored in class, a disillusioned or misused employee or someone who feels frustrated but can&#39;t quite explain why, too many people don&#39;t realize what they are capable of achieving. Through stories of people - like Vidal Sassoon, Ariana Huffington and Matt Groening - who have recognized their unique talents and been able to make a successful living doing what they love, Robinson argues that age and occupation are no barrier and explains how it is possible for each one of us to reach our element. With a wry sense of humour, Ken Robinson inspires us, above all, to reconnect with our true self - it could just change everything.</p><p>Ken Robinson is an internationally recognised leader in the development of creativity, innovation and human resources. He has worked with national governments in Europe and Asia, international agencies, Fortune 500 companies, national and state education systems, non-profit organisations and some of the world&#39;s leading cultural organisations. He was knighted in 2003 for his contribution to education and the arts.<p>Table of Contents</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Title Page</p><p>Copyright Page</p><p>Dedication</p><p>Acknowledgements</p><p>Introduction</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>CHAPTER ONE - The Element</p><p>CHAPTER TWO - Think Differently</p><p>CHAPTER THREE - Beyond Imagining</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR - In the Zone</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE - Finding Your Tribe</p><p>CHAPTER SIX - What Will They Think?</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN - Do You Feel Lucky?</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT - Somebody Help Me</p><p>CHAPTER NINE - Is It Too Late?</p><p>CHAPTER TEN - For Love or Money</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN - Making the Grade</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Afterword</p><p>Notes</p><p>Index</p><p>VIKING <br>Published by the Penguin Group <br>Penguin Group (USA) Inc., 375 Hudson Street, <br>New York, New York 10014, U.S.A. <br>Penguin Group (Canada), 90 Eglinton Avenue East, Suite 700, Toronto, <br>Ontario, Canada M4P 2Y3 (a division of Pearson Penguin Canada Inc.) <br>Penguin Books Ltd, 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England <br>Penguin Ireland, 25 St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green, Dublin 2, Ireland <br>(a division of Penguin Books Ltd) <br>Penguin Books Australia Ltd, 250 Camberwell Road, Camberwell, <br>Victoria 3124, Australia (a division of Pearson Australia Group Pty Ltd) <br>Penguin Books India Pvt Ltd, 11 Community Centre, <br>Panchsheel Park, New Delhi - 110 017, India <br>Penguin Group (NZ), 67 Apollo Drive, Rosedale, North Shore 0632, <br>New Zealand (a division of Pearson New Zealand Ltd) <br>Penguin Books (South Africa) (Pty) Ltd, 24 Sturdee Avenue, <br>Rosebank, Johannesburg 2196, South Africa</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Penguin Books Ltd, Registered Offices: 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>First published in 2009 by Viking Penguin, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>Copyright � Ken Robinson and Lou Aronica, 2009<p></p><p>All rights reserved</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Artwork on page 65: NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)-ESA/ Hubble Collaboration.

Rearing a book like this takes a small metropolis. I know I have to say I can&#x2019;t thank everyone, and I really can&#x2019;t. I do have to single out a few people, though, for special service awards.</p><p>First and foremost, my wife and partner, Terry. This book simply wouldn&#x2019;t be in your hands but for her. Its origins were in an off-the-cuff remark I made at a conference a few years ago. I had just told the Gillian Lynne story, which now opens chapter 1 of the book. In passing, I said that one of these days I was going to write a book about stories like that. I&#x2019;ve since learned not to say these things out loud in front of Terry. She asked me when did I have in mind. &#x201c;Soon,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;definitely soon.&#x201d; After a few months had passed, she started it herself, wrote the proposal, worked on the ideas, did some of the initial interviews, and then found the agent, Peter Miller, who was to help make it happen. With the foundations laid so solidly, and the escape routes closed so firmly, I finally kept my word and got on with the book.</p><p>I want to thank Peter Miller, our literary agent, for all his great work, not least in bringing Lou Aronica and me together. I travel a lot&#x2014;too much, really&#x2014;and producing a book like this needs time, energy, and collaboration. Lou was the ideal partner. He is seriously professional: sage, judicious, creative, and patient. He was the calm center of the project as I orbited the earth, sending notes, drafts, and second thoughts from airports and hotel rooms. Between us, we also managed to steer a successful course between the often comic conflicts of British and American English. Thank you, Lou.</p><p>My son, James, gave up his precious, final student summer to pore over archives, journals, and Internet sites, checking facts, dates, and ideas. Then he debated virtually every idea in the book with me until I was worn out. Nancy Allen worked for several months on research issues under increasingly tight deadlines. My daughter, Kate, had a wonderfully creative collaboration with Nick Egan to produce a unique Web site that shows all the other work we&#x2019;re now doing. Our assistant, Andrea Hanna, worked tirelessly to orchestrate the myriad moving parts in a project like this. We wouldn&#x2019;t still be standing up without her.</p><p>As the book was taking shape, we were extremely fortunate to have the wise and creative counsel of our publisher, Kathryn Court, at Viking Penguin. Her benign form of intimidation also ensured that we got the book finished in decent time.</p><p>Finally, I have to thank all of those whose stories illuminate this book. Many of them spent precious hours, amid very busy lives, to talk freely and passionately about the experiences and ideas that lie at the heart of <i>The Element</i>. Many others sent me moving letters and e-mails. Their stories show that the issues in this book reach into the core of our lives. I thank all of them.</p><p>It&#x2019;s usual to say, of course, that whatever good things other people have contributed, any faults that remain in the book are my responsibility alone. That seems a bit harsh to me, but I suppose it&#x2019;s true.</p><p><i>Introduction</i></p><p>A FEW YEARS AGO, I heard a wonderful story, which I&#x2019;m very fond of telling. An elementary school teacher was giving a drawing class to a group of six-year-old children. At the back of the classroom sat a little girl who normally didn&#x2019;t pay much attention in school. In the drawing class she did. For more than twenty minutes, the girl sat with her arms curled around her paper, totally absorbed in what she was doing. The teacher found this fascinating. Eventually, she asked the girl what she was drawing. Without looking up, the girl said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m drawing a picture of God.&#x201d; Surprised, the teacher said, &#x201c;But nobody knows what God looks like.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl said, &#x201c;They will in a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>I love this story because it reminds us that young children are wonderfully confident in their own imaginations. Most of us lose this confidence as we grow up. Ask a class of first graders which of them thinks they&#x2019;re creative and they&#x2019;ll all put their hands up. Ask a group of college seniors this same question and most of them won&#x2019;t. I believe passionately that we are all born with tremendous natural capacities, and that we lose touch with many of them as we spend more time in the world. Ironically, one of the main reasons this happens is education. The result is that too many people never connect with their true talents and therefore don&#x2019;t know what they&#x2019;re really capable of achieving.</p><p>In that sense, they don&#x2019;t know who they really are.</p><p>I travel a great deal and work with people all around the world. I work with education systems, with corporations, and with not-for-profit organizations. Everywhere, I meet students who are trying to figure out their futures and don&#x2019;t know where to start. I meet concerned parents who are trying to help them but instead often steer them away from their true talents on the assumption that their kids have to follow conventional routes to success. I meet employers who are struggling to understand and make better use of the diverse talents of the people in their companies. Along the way, I&#x2019;ve lost track of the numbers of people I&#x2019;ve met who have no real sense of what their individual talents and passions are. They don&#x2019;t enjoy what they are doing now but they have no idea what actually would fulfill them.</p><p>On the other hand, I also meet people who&#x2019;ve been highly successful in all kinds of fields who are passionate about what they do and couldn&#x2019;t imagine doing anything else. I believe that their stories have something important to teach all of us about the nature of human capacity and fulfillment. As I&#x2019;ve spoken at events around the world, I&#x2019;ve found it&#x2019;s real stories like these, at least as much as statistics and the opinions of experts, that persuade people that we all need to think differently about ourselves and about what we&#x2019;re doing with our lives; about how we&#x2019;re educating our children and how we&#x2019;re running our organizations.</p><p>This book contains a wide range of stories about the creative journeys of very different people. Many of them were interviewed specifically for this book. These people tell how they first came to recognize their unique talents and how they make a highly successful living from doing what they love. What strikes me is that often their journeys haven&#x2019;t been conventional. They&#x2019;ve been full of twists, turns, and surprises. Often those I interviewed said that our conversations for the book revealed ideas and experiences they hadn&#x2019;t discussed in this way before. The moment of recognition. The evolution of their talents. The encouragement or discouragement of family, friends, and teachers. What made them forge ahead in the face of numerous obstacles.</p><p>Their stories are not fairy tales, though. All of these people are leading complicated and challenging lives. Their personal journeys have not been easy and straightforward. They&#x2019;ve all had their disasters as well as their triumphs. None of them have &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; lives. But all of them regularly experience moments that feel like perfection. Their stories are often fascinating.</p><p>But this book isn&#x2019;t really about them. It&#x2019;s about you.</p><p>My aim in writing it is to offer a richer vision of human ability and creativity and of the benefits to us all of connecting properly with our individual talents and passions. This book is about issues that are of fundamental importance in our lives and in the lives of our children, our students, and the people we work with. I use the term <i>the Element</i> to describe the place where the things we love to do and the things we are good at come together. I believe it is essential that each of us find his or her Element, not simply because it will make us more fulfilled but because, as the world evolves, the very future of our communities and institutions will depend on it.</p><p>The world is changing faster than ever in our history. Our best hope for the future is to develop a new paradigm of human capacity to meet a new era of human existence. We need to evolve a new appreciation of the importance of nurturing human talent along with an understanding of how talent expresses itself differently in every individual. We need to create environments&#x2014;in our schools, in our workplaces, and in our public offices&#x2014;where every person is inspired to grow creatively. We need to make sure that all people have the chance to do what they should be doing, to discover the Element in themselves and in their own way.</p><p>This book is a hymn to the breathtaking diversity of human talent and passion and to our extraordinary potential for growth and development. It&#x2019;s also about understanding the conditions under which human talents will flourish or fade. It&#x2019;s about how we can all engage more fully in the present, and how we can prepare in the only possible way for a completely unknowable future.</p><p>To make the best of ourselves and of each other, we urgently need to embrace a richer conception of human capacity. We need to embrace the Element.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>The Element</p><p>GILLIAN WAS ONLY eight years old, but her future was already at risk. Her schoolwork was a disaster, at least as far as her teachers were concerned. She turned in assignments late, her handwriting was terrible, and she tested poorly. Not only that, she was a disruption to the entire class, one minute fidgeting noisily, the next staring out the window, forcing the teacher to stop the class to pull Gillian&#x2019;s attention back, and the next doing something to disturb the other children around her. Gillian wasn&#x2019;t particularly concerned about any of this&#x2014;she was used to being corrected by authority figures and really didn&#x2019;t see herself as a difficult child&#x2014;but the school was very concerned. This came to a head when the school wrote to her parents.</p><p>The school thought that Gillian had a learning disorder of some sort and that it might be more appropriate for her to be in a school for children with special needs. All of this took place in the 1930s. I think now they&#x2019;d say she had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and they&#x2019;d put her on Ritalin or something similar. But the ADHD epidemic hadn&#x2019;t been invented at the time. It wasn&#x2019;t an available condition. People didn&#x2019;t know they could have that and had to get by without it.</p><p>Gillian&#x2019;s parents received the letter from the school with great concern and sprang to action. Gillian&#x2019;s mother put her daughter in her best dress and shoes, tied her hair in ponytails, and took her to a psychologist for assessment, fearing the worst.</p><p>Gillian told me that she remembers being invited into a large oak-paneled room with leather-bound books on the shelves. Standing in the room next to a large desk was an imposing man in a tweed jacket. He took Gillian to the far end of the room and sat her down on a huge leather sofa. Gillian&#x2019;s feet didn&#x2019;t quite touch the floor, and the setting made her wary. Nervous about the impression she would make, she sat on her hands so that she wouldn&#x2019;t fidget.</p><p>The psychologist went back to his desk, and for the next twenty minutes, he asked Gillian&#x2019;s mother about the difficulties Gillian was having at school and the problems the school said she was causing. While he didn&#x2019;t direct any of his questions at Gillian, he watched her carefully the entire time. This made Gillian extremely uneasy and confused. Even at this tender age, she knew that this man would have a significant role in her life. She knew what it meant to attend a &#x201c;special school,&#x201d; and she didn&#x2019;t want anythi...</p></p><h2>Whispers Along the Rails (Postcards from Pullman Series #2)</h2><p>Olivia Mott finds herself juggling two jobs: her assistant chef position at Hotel Florence and her undercover work for the Pullman Rail Car Company. Olivia thinks the suggestions she relays to Pullman's town manager are being used to improve conditions for workers and save the company money, but is something much more sinister happening behind the scenes?<br><br>Several months have passed since Lady Charlotte fled to Chicago, leaving her infant son in Olivia's care. Now Charlotte's money has run out. A kindly woman offers her a place to live and secures her a position at Marshall Field's store, but Charlotte's heart can't forget the past. Dare she return to Pullman to find out what happened to her baby?</p><p>Judith Miller is an award-winning author whose avid research and love for history are reflected in her bestselling novels. When time permits, Judy enjoys traveling, visiting historical settings, and scrapbooking the photographs from her travel expeditions. She makes her home in Topeka, Kansas.&#34;An excellent story, full of cliff-hanging crises for the heroine, a young woman having to fend for herself in the Victorian Age. She succeeds against the background of Pullman, the &#34;perfect&#34; town, built in the 1880s for workers of George Pullman&#39;s Pullman Palace Car Company, builder of luxurious passenger train cars. This innovative community, although not the utopia it was purported to be at the time, was a major player very important in the history of the United States during the Industrial Age. Although this tale is fictional, Miller&#39;s research into the real town is a job well done.&#34;</p><h2>Fear of Dreaming: The Selected Poems (Penguin Poets)</h2><p>Carroll, a diarist and rock performer, is best known for his coming-of-age memoir&nbsp;<i>The Basketball Diaries</i>, which became an instant classic when it was first published in 1978 and then a national bestseller when a film version of the book was released in 1995. Carroll initially made his reputation as a poet, and has won acclaim and comparisons to everyone from Rimbaud to Frank O&#x2019;Hara for his delicate yet hallucinatory imagery.<br><br>This volume of poetry collects selections from Jim Carroll&#x2019;s <i>Living at the Movies</i>, which was published in 1973 when he was twenty-two, and <i>The Book of Nods</i>, released in 1986. <i>Fear of</i> <i>Dreaming </i>also includes pieces previously unpublished in book form, including &#x201c;Curtis&#x2019;s Charm,&#x201d; a vignette set in New York City&#x2019;s Central Park about a man convinced he is a victim of black magic, and poetic tributes to Robert Mapplethorpe and Ted Berrigan. <br><br> &#x201c;His poems&#x2019; urgent, obsessive metaphors pose tensely against their cool, streetwise surface voice, charging them with an electricity that&#x2019;s at once disturbing, sexual, religious, and psychological.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tom Clark, <i>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i></p><p>Jim Carroll&#x2019;s bestselling memoir <i>The Basketball Diaries</i> was first released in 1978 and adapted as a film in 1995.

In 1942, Heinkel received a contract to develop the twin-engined He 219. Not only was the He 219 very fast, with a maximum speed in excess of 600 km/h, but it also possessed excellent maneuverability, had a well-designed cockpit, and was equipped with airborne radar. The He 219 was the first German production aircraft to have a tricycle undercarriage and ejector seats for both crew members. The author provides many previously unpublished details in describing the development history of the He 219, the technology it employed, its testing, production, and use in combat.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Grave Injustice: The American Indian Repatriation Movement and NAGPRA (Fourth World Rising)</h2><p><i>Grave Injustice</i> is the powerful story of the ongoing struggle of Native Americans to repatriate the objects and remains of their ancestors that were appropriated, collected, manipulated, sold, and displayed by Europeans and Americans. Anthropologist Kathleen S. Fine-Dare focuses on the history and culture of both the impetus to collect and the movement to repatriate Native American remains. <p>Using a straightforward historical framework and illuminating case studies, Fine-Dare first examines the changing cultural reasons for the appropriation of Native American remains. She then traces the succession of incidents, laws, and changing public and Native attitudes that have shaped the repatriation movement since the late nineteenth century. Her discussion and examples make clear that the issue is a complex one, that few clear-cut heroes or villains make up the history of the repatriation movement, and that little consensus about policy or solutions exists within or beyond academic and Native communities.</p><p>The concluding chapters of this history take up the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which Fine-Dare considers as a legal and cultural document. This highly controversial federal law was the result of lobbying by American Indian and Native Hawaiian peoples to obtain federal support for the right to bring back to their communities the human remains and associated objects that are housed in federally funded institutions all over the United States.</p><p><i>Grave Injustice</i> is a balanced introduction to a longstanding and complicated problem that continues to mobilize and threatens to divide Native Americans and the scholars who work with and write about them.</p></p><p>Kathleen S. Fine-Dare is a professor of anthropology and women's studies at Fort Lewis College. She is the author of <i>Cotocollao: Ideologia, historia, y acci&#x2014;n en un barrio de Quito</i>.&#34;Grave Injustice is a fine book that provides the reader with an understanding of the need for NAGPRA, the history of its passage and implementation to date, and the differing perceptions that people have of the law.&#34;-Sharon O&#39;Brien, Western Historical Quarterly -- Sharon O&#39;Brien * Western Historical Quarterly * &#34;This work is a detailed, frank, and though-provoking look at the development and implementation of NAGPRA. It is extensively researched and illustrated with numerous well placed examples from Native American experience. . . . Despite its difficult, disturbing subject matter, this book is compelling reading. It is an excellent review of the cultural context of NAGPRA. . . . A valuable resource for individuals and organizations faced with the daunting, emotionally charged task of repatriation officers, museum curators, cultural leaders, anthroplogists, and legislators alike.&#34;-Amy Steffian, Alaska History -- Amy Steffian * Alaska History * &#34;Fine-Dare presents a sensitive review of the American Indian repatriation movement and its legal basis in the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). . . . Strange as it may seem, some archaeologists still maintain that NAGPRA is a political move that threatens science. Therefore, Fine-Dare&#39;s book is required reading for students of anthropology at all levels.&#34;-Choice * CHOICE *</p><h2>We&#39;ll Meet Again (The Mulligan Sisters)</h2><p>Now in its third year, World War II still rages, taking its toll on everyone.

Though Raitt Castle lies not far beyond the next ridge, headstrong Lady Catriona &#x201c;Katy&#x201d; MacFinlagh of Clan Mackintosh has never seen it. When her curiosity and rebellious spirit compel her to scale a nearby peak in hopes of catching a glimpse, Katy loses her footing, and a broad-shouldered stranger, appearing seemingly out of nowhere, saves her from a fatal fall.<br> &nbsp;<br> Spellbound by the young tawny-haired beauty he has rescued, William Comyn neglects to reveal his full identity to her. As Will and Katy begin to meet in secret and their strong mutual attraction deepens toward love, the clan feud once again erupts in violence, making it harder and harder for Will to reveal that he is a Comyn. But when Will learns that Katy&#x2019;s clan is in imminent danger, he must decide between his newfound love and his sacred honor, and Katy must choose between her pride and her heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> Set in the same north central Scottish Highlands as <i>The Reluctant Highlander</i>, <i>The Kissing Stone </i>is a historically rich and fiercely passionate Scottish romance from the Rita Award&#x2013;winning author &#x201c;frequently credited with creating the subgenre&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>).<br> &nbsp;<br> The Kissing Stone<i> is the 2nd book in the Highland Nights series, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.</i></p><p>A fourth-generation Californian of Scottish descent, Amanda Scott is the author of more than fifty romantic novels, many of which appeared on the&nbsp;<i>USA Today</i>&nbsp;bestseller list.

In <i>Rain</i>, Melissa Harrison follows the course of four rain showers, in four seasons, across Wicken Fen, Shropshire, the Darent Valley and Dartmoor.

The Vision of God is known as a classic of Christian mysticism, putting many believers in touch with the divine.<p>Many Christians have a desire to experience God, rather than just believe in Him. Nicholas of Cusa provides an excellent guidebook for Christians who sense something deeper to the Christian experience. He was a mystic. He experienced God on a number of levels and taught people to move beyond mere belief and have similar experiences.</p><p>By bringing spiritual principles into the Christian religious setting, Nicholas was able to instruct and enrich thousands of people. This he did at a time when Christianity was beginning to cast a long shadow of strict dogma over the masses -- it was the dawning of the Inquisition -- yet Nicholas was able to keep his mystical teachings Safely within the boundaries of the Church.</p><p>During this incredibly busy and volatile time, Nicholas engaged himself whenever he could in meditation and study. It is from these introspective journeys that he received his spiritual insights. He also spent much time with a group of Benedictine monks, who asked for spiritual guidance from Nicholas after recognizing his gifts. Nicholas responded with The Vision of God in December of 1453. A rare classic brought back into print.</p></p><p>A German cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, NICHOLAS OF CUSA (1401-1464) was a philosopher, jurist, mathematician, and astronomer.

Writers embrace the memoir and readers devour it, propelling many memoirs by relative unknowns to the top of the best-seller list. Writing programs challenge authors to disclose themselves in personal narrative. Memoir and personal narrative urge writers to face the intimacies of the self and ask what is true.<br><br>In <i>The Memoir and the Memoirist</i>, critic and memoirist Thomas Larson explores the craft and purpose of writing this new form. Larson guides the reader from the autobiography and the personal essay to the memoir--a genre focused on a particularly emotional relationship in the author's past, an intimate story concerned more with who is remembering, and why, than with what is remembered.<br><br><i>The Memoir and the Memoirist</i> touches on the nuances of memory, of finding and telling the truth, and of disclosing one's deepest self. It explores the craft and purpose of personal narrative by looking in detail at more than a dozen examples by writers such as Mary Karr, Frank McCourt, Dave Eggers, Elizabeth Wurtzel, Mark Doty, Nuala O'Faolain, Rick Bragg, and Joseph Lelyveld to show what they reveal about themselves. Larson also opens up his own writing and that of his students to demonstrate the hidden mechanics of the writing process.<br><br>For both the interested reader of memoir and the writer wrestling with the craft<i>, The Memoir and the Memoirist</i> provides guidance and insight into the many facets of this provocative and popular art form.</p><p>Journalist, critic, and memoirist, <b>Thomas Larson</b> is the author of three books: <i>The Sanctuary of Illness: A Memoir of Heart Disease</i>, <i>The Saddest Music Ever Written: The Story of Samuel Barber'</i>s "Adagio for Strings," and <i>The Memoir and the Memoirist: Reading and Writing Personal Narrative</i>.

The age of sail is passing and Lt. Peter Wake finds himself again in Key West, but this time in command of a steamer, the <i>U.S.S. Hunt</i>. He quickly plunges into action as he chases a mystery ship during a tropical storm off Cuba, deals with a seductively dangerous woman during a mission in enemy territory ashore, confronts death to liberate an escaping slave ship, and comes face to face with the enemy's most powerful warship in Havana's harbor. Wake is no longer alone in this dangerous world. His wife Linda, hiding in a pro-Union camp on Useppa Island, gives him a future to look forward to as the war nears its end. But then in January 1866, as most Union soldiers are preparing to go home, a powerful ocean raider shows up in a remote corner of the Caribbean, and Wake finds that for some the war is not over yet.

Biological weapons were the first weapon prohibited by an international treaty, yet the proliferation of these weapons increased after they were banned in 1972. Biological weapons are frequently called 'the poor man's atomic bomb,' yet they cannot provide the same deterrent capability as nuclear weapons. One of my goals in this book is to explain the underlying principles of these apparent paradoxes."&#x2015;from Living Weapons</p><p>Biological weapons are the least well understood of the so-called weapons of mass destruction. Unlike nuclear and chemical weapons, biological weapons are composed of, or derived from, living organisms. In Living Weapons, Gregory D. Koblentz provides a comprehensive analysis of the unique challenges that biological weapons pose for international security.</p><p>At a time when the United States enjoys overwhelming conventional military superiority, biological weapons have emerged as an attractive means for less powerful states and terrorist groups to wage asymmetric warfare. Koblentz also warns that advances in the life sciences have the potential to heighten the lethality and variety of biological weapons. The considerable overlap between the equipment, materials and knowledge required to develop biological weapons, conduct civilian biomedical research, and develop biological defenses creates a multiuse dilemma that limits the effectiveness of verification, hinders civilian oversight, and complicates threat assessments.</p><p>Living Weapons draws on the American, Soviet, Russian, South African, and Iraqi biological weapons programs to enhance our understanding of the special challenges posed by these weapons for arms control, deterrence, civilian-military relations, and intelligence. Koblentz also examines the aspirations of terrorist groups to develop these weapons and the obstacles they have faced. Biological weapons, Koblentz argues, will continue to threaten international security until defenses against such weapons are improved, governments can reliably detect biological weapon activities, the proliferation of materials and expertise is limited, and international norms against the possession and use of biological weapons are strengthened.</p></p><p>"<i>Living Weapons</i> promises to stimulate attention and provoke thought on a very important topic. Gregory D. Koblentz writes clearly about the problems posed by biological weapons and provides particularly good summary accounts of the Soviet, Iraqi, and South African offensive programs."--John D. Steinbruner, University of Maryland, author of <i>The Cybernetic Theory of Decision</i> <p> "Gregory D. Koblentz's comprehensive and insightful study explores the unique dilemmas that biological weapons pose for defense, intelligence, arms control, and global governance.

Among the world's many democracies, U.S. presidential elections are unique, where presidential contenders embark on a grueling, spectacular two-year journey that begins in Iowa and New Hampshire, and ends at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Modern presidential campaigns are a marked departure from the process envisioned by America's founders. Yet while they've evolved, many of the basic structures of our original electoral system remain in place&#x2015;even as presidential elections have moved into the modern era with tools like Twitter and Facebook at their disposal&#x2015;they must still compete in an election governed by rules and mechanisms conceived in the late eighteenth century. In this book, Clift and Spieler demonstrate that presidential campaigns are exciting, hugely important, disillusioning at times but also inspiring.</p></p><p><b>Eleanor Clift</b> is a political reporter, television pundit and author.

Once every four years, the usual sitcoms, primetime dramas, and reality shows give way to special news coverage: America is electing a new president.<br>As Election Night unfolds, a map of the United States begins to take shape. States won by Democrats are colored in blue, while those won by Republicans are shaded red. Sometimes, the night unfolds at an agonizingly slow pace.<br>The first news of the night usually trickles in around 7 p.m., after a few states with early poll closings report their results. Vermont&#x2019;s three electoral votes, not surprisingly, go to one party. The other standard-bearer wins Kentucky, as expected. An hour or two later, if all goes smoothly and it&#x2019;s not an especially close election, the networks declare winners in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, and the outcome becomes clearer.<br>Election night can be filled with drama and surprises. Some candidates will win states they were projected to lose, and vice versa. Alternatively, Election Night can be a rather dull affair, as the outcome may not have been in doubt for months leading up to the voting.<br>On Election Day, the presidency is far from the only important political office up for grabs. All members of the House of Representatives and roughly one third of U.S. senators must also stand for election on that same day. But in presidential election years, the race for the White House is undoubtedly the main event.<br>Election Day in the United States is the culmination of a long, grueling process that tests those who seek the highest office in the land&#x2014;and the leadership of the free world. While most Americans may only have been paying attention to the campaign for a matter of weeks, it has, in fact, been more than two years in the making.<br>Mere days after a new president takes office (or returns to office if he was reelected) the media turns its attention to the next campaign. Whether they&#x2019;re reporters, bloggers, or talking heads, the media will pontificate about what the next campaign will look like. Familiar names are mentioned, and leading critics of the president will give speeches and interviews in which they try to assume the leadership of the &#x201c;loyal opposition.&#x201d;<br>Two years into a president&#x2019;s term, the presidential race comes into clearer focus. Following the midterm elections (which occur every two years, and in which members of both houses of Congress, as well as governors and state legislatures are elected), presidential aspirants form what are called &#x201c;exploratory committees.&#x201d; Exploratory committees allow candidates to test the waters for a national campaign. At this early stage of a campaign, presidential hopefuls hire pollsters who gauge their popularity, and meet with local elected officials and political activists around the country. They raise money&#x2014;and they will need to raise a lot of it in order to be taken seriously as a viable candidate to carry the Democratic or Republican banner in the presidential election.<br>There are, of course, third parties and independent candidates who run under no party label at all. Occasionally, these independent candidates have a major impact on the presidential race. By advocating such progressive policies as an eight-hour workday and voting rights for women, Teddy Roosevelt&#x2019;s Bull Moose Party garnered 27 percent of the vote in 1912, insuring the defeat of Republican president Howard Taft and helping to elect Democrat Woodrow Wilson. In 1992, third party candidate Ross Perot (who ran under the Reform Party banner) received nearly 20 percent of the vote. However, every U.S. president has been a Democrat or Republican since 1857. Thus, for all intents and purposes, voters have two major political parties from which to choose their president.<br>Some argue that third party candidates play the role of &#x201c;spoiler.&#x201d; (In elections, the term &#x201c;spoiler&#x201d; refers to a candidate who has little or no chance of winning but draws enough votes away from a major candidate to cost him the election.) While the chances of a third party candidate winning the presidency may be remote, these dark horses can have an impact at the margins. For example, many Democrats still believe that Ralph Nader&#x2019;s share of the vote in Florida cost Al Gore the presidency in 2000. Nader ran under the Green Party banner, and attracted support from disaffected liberals who believed Gore had failed to stand up for progressive ideals.<br>This early period of the campaign marks the beginning of the &#x201c;primary season.&#x201d; During the primaries, each state holds its own election. In closed primaries, voters choose from their own party. Registered Democratic voters choose from a field of Democratic candidates. Republican voters, meanwhile, vote for their preferred politician among an exclusively Republican field of candidates.<br>The rules governing the primaries vary by state. In New York, for example, only Democratic voters may vote in the Democratic primary, while the Republican primary is closed to all except registered Republican voters. In New Hampshire&#x2019;s &#x201c;open primary,&#x201d; however, independent voters (who are not registered with either party) can vote in whichever primary they choose. (Of course, even in open primaries, voters may only cast one ballot&#x2014;they may vote in either the Democratic or the Republican primaries, but <i>not</i> both contests.)<br>Fourteen states&#x2014;Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, Iowa, Nevada, Nebraska, Washington, Maine, Wyoming, Texas, and Utah hold &#x201c;caucuses&#x201d; on Election Day, where political activists assemble to openly lobby for candidates and divvy up their support. The Iowa caucuses kick off the primary season and have achieved outsized influence in the presidential selection process for the small, mostly rural state. Texas also has a primary, making it the only state where residents can legally vote twice.<br>Early &#x201c;straw polls&#x201d; shape perceptions of the strength of the various candidates, but are not binding. The Ames, Iowa, straw poll on behalf of the Republican Party is the most famous. Held on a Saturday in August the year before the election, it has become a costly venture for candidates who build their numbers by busing people in and providing free food and entertainment. GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney, who spent more than a million dollars to win a narrow victory in 2007, skipped the Iowa caucus in 2011, ceding prime space in the arena to Representative Ron Paul, who paid $31,000 to the Republican state party for the honor.<br>By campaigning during the primaries, candidates are vying to win delegates from each state. The ultimate goal is to win enough delegates to clinch the Democratic or Republican nomination. After all of the primary elections and caucuses are over, each political party holds a convention and nominates the candidate who receives the support of the most delegates. (This process is actually more complicated, and will be explained in greater detail later.)<br>By the end of the primary season, voters in every state of the Union (as well as territories such as Puerto Rico) have cast their votes for the nominees of America&#x2019;s two major political parties. Only after every state has completed this process can the general election begin in which the Democratic candidate faces off against the Republican.<br>After the Democratic and Republican parties nominate their candidates, in late August and early September, the general election begins in earnest. The two candidates &#x201c;barnstorm the country,&#x201d; standard-bearers for America&#x2019;s two major political philosophies in a battle for control of the White House. The Republican will run on a platform of lower taxes, scaling back or eliminating some programs, and less government regulation of business and financial dealings. The Democrat generally runs on a platform of maintaining or perhaps expanding the social safety net, aid to the poor, environmental protection, and support for organized labor. Differences over foreign policy can also define the two candidates. Republicans are often seen as backing a more hawkish, aggressive foreign policy that emphasizes military strength, while the Democrat might be more inclined to emphasize international cooperation and diplomacy.<br>Following the two parties&#x2019; conventions, the general election kicks into high gear. Both candidates spend their time campaigning almost exclusively in states that are considered &#x201c;toss-ups,&#x201d; or &#x201c;swing states&#x201d;&#x2014;in other words, states that do not lean strongly toward one political party in presidential elections. The Democratic candidate, for example, will not campaign in heavily Democratic Massachusetts during the general election. The Republican will not waste time campaigning in Idaho, which is safely Republican.<br>Ohio residents, meanwhile, will see a lot of both candidates. So will Pennsylvanians, Michiganders, and Floridians. Meanwhile, the voters of Vermont, New York, Hawaii, Alaska, and South Carolina are all but forgotten, as their votes are seldom seen as up for grabs.<br>During this period of the campaign&#x2014;usually in late September and October&#x2014;the presidential candidates will participate in a live, nationally televised debate. While these debates rarely doom a candidate or rescue him from a badly ailing campaign&#x2014;they can prove to be consequential. Just weeks before voters go to the polls, viewer perceptions of presidential candidates take shape and solidify as the two contenders go toe-to-toe.<br>On Election Day, presidential campaigning comes to an end. (The Constitution requires that Election Day be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.) Voters go to the polls and later settle into their living rooms to watch the election returns on television. The two candidates, with much fanfare, visit t...</p><h2>Bitter Gold Hearts (Garrett, P.I., Book 2)</h2><p>The Stormwarden&#39;s children have been kidnapped and Garrett, P.I. is on the case.

The U.S. Army in Europe sustained 77,726 casualties in December, and incurred a further 69,119 casualties in January. In December, 15,333 soldiers and airmen lost their lives, and January was not much better: An additional 12,190 soldiers and airmen perished. In total, in those two months our country sustained 146,845 casualties, and of those, 27,523 were deaths. Most of those occurred in that forty-day period when Germany and the United States were locked in the largest battle of the Western Front.</p><p>In contrast, in July 1863, the month of Gettysburg and Vicksburg, our country, both North and South, suffered 120,426 casualties combined. In fifty-one days, from May through June 1864, when the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse, and Cold Harbor raged, the butcher&#x2019;s bill was 146,046 casualties. The only other bloodletting that came close to the Bulge&#x2019;s total was during the forty-seven days of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in October and November 1918, when the U.S. Army Expeditionary Force lost 122,063 men, and of those, 26,277 were deaths.</p><p>In short, the Battle of the Bulge was truly a national sacrifice, on par with the battles of Gettysburg and the Meuse-Argonne. Citizens of Belgium and Luxembourg still remember our sacrifice and annually commemorate the events of those dark days.Yet many of our own students know little about the Bulge. Their lack of historical appreciation is the number one reason why I chose this subject.</p><p>Yet it is not the only reason. The Bulge and the Siege of Bastogne are also compelling stories. When Don Cygan and I decided to publish <i>No Silent Night: The Christmas Battle for Bastogne</i>, I already had planned to write the sequel, because the story about Bastogne is a two-part saga. The most popular is the account about the 101st Airborne Division and its epic defense of the city. However, every story about a besieged force usually has two armies involved: the besieged and the forces sent to relieve them. Now is the time to tell the tale of Patton&#x2019;s 4th Armored Division and their race to relieve the paratroopers and glider men of the 101st.</p><p>Like <i>No Silent Night</i>, <i>Patton at the Battle of the Bulge</i> provides a German viewpoint to contrast with the American perspective. This story follows several German soldiers who fought with the 5th Fallschirmj�ger Division. Contrary to popular myth, not all German soldiers were monsters. In this book are several examples where German soldiers showed remarkable kindness and mercy toward their sworn enemies, the American army. Sadly, there are also examples of brutality, where German soldiers executed innocent Belgian civilians.</p><p>True, Belgian civilians did perish as a result of American bombs, but those bombs were not meant for the hapless civilians hiding in houses and huddling in cellars. Surgical strikes did not exist in 1944 and 1945, because bombings were far less accurate in World War II than they are today. My research revealed several incidents where Allied aircraft even strafed and bombed <i>American</i> tanks instead of German panzers. In the cloud of war, good intentions did not always result in accurate targeting. On the other hand, the Germans did intend to execute civilians.</p><p>Furthermore, this work provides a civilian point of view. For those living in the path of these armies, the days around Christmas were harrowing ones. In many cases, they exhibited as much amazing courage and selfless sacrifice as the soldiers and tankers who fought among them. This book is also a story about them.</p><p>In addition, I dramatize the German operational briefings, turning them into dialogues. I know some purists might balk at that technique, but I want to present an enthralling story, not a dry account. The words in the briefings are almost entirely verbatim from the sources. In many instances, all I added were quotation marks.</p><p><i>Patton at the Battle of the Bulge</i>, like all good books, was a collaborative effort. I made use of several German and local accounts, for which I would like to thank Roland Gaul, who provided them, including several valuable video interviews and letters; Guy Ries and his website on Bigonville. J�rg Herzig also gave me the lengthy account of Conrad Klemment, which proved indispensable in this story. I would like to thank Ivan Steenkiste, who was crucial in supplying me with information about the battles around Chaumont. His website is a treasure trove of information.</p><p>On the American side, I would like to offer my gratitude to several individuals. Jamie Leach, the son of Jimmie Leach, was an excellent resource in regard to his father. His father&#x2019;s 37th Tank Battalion radio logs, complete with notations, were a wealth of information. Rochelle Dwight gave me great material on her father, William Dwight. She still sends me hilarious daily e-mails that make me laugh. I would like to thank Robert T. Murrell, an 80th Infantry Division veteran, who helped me find information on the 318th Infantry Regiment. Andrew Adkins, the archivist for the 80th Infantry Division website, was hugely instrumental in assisting me with personnel records and personal stories from the 318th. I would like to extend my thanks to Chris Bucholtz and Lynn Gamma, who helped me with finding records concerning the 362nd Fighter Group. I would like to thank Doris Davis, an executive officer for the Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge Association. Without her help, I would have never been able to contact countless veterans and their families.</p><p>Most important are the veterans and their families who provided me their accounts via questionnaires, letters, or interviews. The following accounts were invaluable to the story of the 4th Armored Division and their support elements: Roscoe M. Mulvey Jr., Armand Poirier, Bob Shaw, Jim Sanders, William Leaphart, Howard Lipscomb, Irving Heath, George Whitten, Robert Calvert, Matteo Damiano, Michael George, Eugene Wright, John P. Tvrdovsky, the family of Jack Holmes, Albert Gaydos and the Gaydos family, and Raymond Green. A special thanks goes out to Irving Heath, who provided me his personal photo album from the war. In addition to Irving Heath, another special thanks goes out to Robert Riley&#x2019;s family, especially his daughter, Linda Riggs, who provided me several written accounts about his wartime experiences. Of course, one of the most valuable interviews was with retired brigadier general Albin F. Irzyk. I spent several hours speaking with him about his experiences. His memory was as sharp as a tack, and it was a wonderful experience providing him with information on the Germans who fought his unit at Chaumont. His autobiography was also an amazing source of information about the 4th Armored Division.</p><p>In addition to veterans&#x2019; interviews, several researchers and archivists also supported me in this endeavor. I would like to thank Dieter Stenger, who once again translated dozens of German documents into English. I would like to thank Susan Strange and Tim Frank, who spent innumerable hours poring over documents in the National Archives at College Park, Maryland. Without them, I would not have had thousands of valuable primary sources to examine. William Murray was my researcher at the Army Historical Education Center and helped me with the Oscar W. Koch collection, which was essential to the 4th Armored Division story. Megan Harris was my contact at the Library of Congress&#x2019;s Veterans Oral History Project. Her assistance was instrumental in my success. Javier Tome, a specialist on the 653rd Schwere Panzerj�ger Battalion, sent to me some interesting information on the whereabouts of the 653rd, and his contribution helped me answer the question of who attacked Major Albin Irzyk on December 23 in Chaumont.</p><p>I would be remiss if I did not mention Don M. Fox, author of <i>Patton&#x2019;s Vanguard: The United States Army Fourth Armored Division</i>. A good historian always builds on the work of other great historians. Don&#x2019;s book was my introduction to the 4th Armored Division. Though I had known about the 4th Armored, it was always in a supporting role to the 101st. After reading Don&#x2019;s book, I realized how special the 4th Armored Division truly was, and I decided to start where he left off. Furthermore, his personal input helped me clear up several issues. His work was first-rate, and it still is the seminal book on the 4th Armored&#x2019;s impact in the Second World War.</p><p>I would like to thank my agent, George Bick. His excellent advice pointed me in the right direction, and he is a superb sounding board for ideas. I would also like to thank Talia Platz, my editor, who offered me another chance at NAL Caliber. I hope you do not regret it! I cannot forget Brent Howard, who was my second editor at NAL. Thank you for your title ideas. I owe a debt of gratitude to General Dynamics and the U.S. Army Intelligence Center, which continue to employ me as an instructor at the Military Intelligence Officer Transition Course. Thank you for indulging my research pursuits and allowing me to use the same data from my books to teach future military intelligence officers in the United States Army.</p><p>Last, I would like to thank my wonderful wife, Caulyne. No man is an island, and without her support, none of this would have happened. She is the rock in our marriage, and she is my better half.1</p><p></p><p></p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>| 0845 HOURS, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1944 |</p><p>Lead Platoon, Dog Company, <br>8th Tank Battalion, 4th Armored Division, <br>Southern Outskirts of Chaumont, Belgium</p><p>Private Bruce Fenchel knew Christmas was canceled the moment his first sergeant had barged into his room more than ninety-six hours before and announced, &#x201c;Pack your duffel bags and get ready to roll. One man go to the kitchen and take any food you can get.&#x201d;</p><p>Fenchel had been writing a letter to his mother when the sergeant broke the news, and a collective moan arose from the men. <i>So much for R &amp; R</i>, thought Fenchel. Unmoved, the sergeant continued to bark out orders. &#x201c;The rest of you put the machine guns back on your tanks and gas them and be ready to roll in two hours. The Germans have broken through our line in Bastogne, and Eisenhower has ordered General Patton&#x2019;s 4th Armored to immediately head north.&#x201d;</p><p>Twenty-year-old Fenchel could not believe it. His unit, the 8th Tank Battalion, part of the 4th Armored Division, had been locked in combat for months. Now, after more than eighty days on the line, the Eight Ballers were taking a much-needed break. Unfortunately, the Germans had other plans for the holidays. Instead of relaxing for Christmas, Fenchel and the rest of his division were driving back into battle.</p><p>Two years before, Bruce Donald Fenchel thought he was joining the Army Air Force. At his induction center at Camp Dodge, Des Moines, Iowa, he had taken several tests and passed all with flying colors. To his surprise, he learned that instead he was going to Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he would learn to drive a tank. Initially crestfallen, he remembered that his induction center company commander had suggested that he apply to Officer Candidate School and become an infantry officer. Fenchel knew that an infantry officer had a short life span. Tanks seemed a whole lot safer than being a bullet catcher&#x2014;a foot soldier. He decided against the move, and was off to Fort Knox.1Now, Fenchel&#x2019;s 8th Tank Battalion was under the command of a promising young officer, Major Albin F. Irzyk, who like Fenchel was also in his twenties. Irzyk did not waste much time. Receiving the order to move out, he had pushed his battalion onto the roads early on the morning of December 19. All day and night Fenchel and battalion rolled northward from their staging area at Domnom-l�s-Dieuze in Lorraine, France, all the way into Belgium. By the morning of the twenty-third, they had reached a point several kilometers south of the village of Chaumont.</p><p>The 8th Tank Battalion was part of a larger force known as Combat Command B of the 4th Armored Division. A U.S. Armored Division had three combat commands: A, B, and R (Reserve). Each was a combined arms team that usually was comprised of a tank battalion, an armored infantry battalion, a self-propelled artillery battalion, an assortment of engineers, motorized cavalry (jeeps), and other support units. In addition, each command would further divide its force into task forces, cross-loading various infantry units with armor units. Therefore, 8th Tank Battalion had infantry and tanks as it wound its way north to Bastogne that early morning. Their mission: Get to Bastogne and relieve the 101st Airborne Division before the Germans crushed the beleaguered paratroopers.2Despite the importance of the task ahead, Fenchel simply wanted to stay warm and get some sleep. After clearing the town of Burnon during the previous afternoon, the young tank driver had assumed his unit would establish a perimeter for the night and continue their advance the following morning. He was wrong.</p><p>At 1834 hours, the orders came down from Combat Command B Headquarters over the radio: &#x201c;Push onto Checkpoint Forty-four all night.&#x201d;</p><p>A radio operator from another unit asked higher headquarters to confirm the order. It took them only seven minutes to reply: &#x201c;We are moving on CP Forty-four all night. On foot if necessary.&#x201d; Everyone now knew the command was probably coming from the top man himself&#x2014;Lieutenant General George S. Patton.3Patton, the commander of the U.S. Third Army, sensed that the road to Bastogne was open. His army&#x2019;s spearhead was the 4th Armored Division, and leading the 4th was CCB. At the forefront of Patton&#x2019;s entire army was Private Fenchel in his little Stuart tank. So far, the 4th had met only determined resistance near Martelange, several kilometers southeast of Fenchel&#x2019;s current position.4During World War II, armored units rarely conducted operations during hours of limited visibility. Unlike today, troopers back then did not have night-vision goggles. They drove their vehicles almost bumper-to-bumper, their eyes fixed on the slivers of light in front of them emanating from the partially covered headlights. These covered lights, known as &#x201c;cat&#x2019;s eyes,&#x201d; barely gave off enough light for a man to see, and if he fell too far behind, he would lose sight of the vehicle in front of him.</p><p>Major Irzyk, deciding that the more maneuverable Stuarts and jeeps might be better suited to driving at night than the heavier and slower Shermans, ordered a platoon of jeeps from Baker Troop, 25th Cavalry Squadron, followed by a platoon of light tanks from Dog Company, to take the lead. Around 2300 hours, after they had completed their refueling, his battalion resumed their progress northward. It was slow going. Coupled with a lack of sleep, Fenchel had a hard time staying focused on the vehicle in front of him. At one point, he lost sight of the cat&#x2019;s eyes. When he found them again, it was too late, and his tank crashed into the rear of another tank in his platoon. Luckily, no one was hurt and neither vehicle was damaged.5Finally, after several hours they reached a point about a kilometer and a half south of Chaumont. The top of the sun was barely over the eastern horizo...</p></p><h2>The Hours of Catherine of Cleves</h2><p><p><strong>When this magnificent volume first appeared in 1966, it was celebrated for its extraordinary beauty. Now, it is available once again.</strong></p> Illustrating one of the great art treasures of the world, <em>The Hours of Catherine of Cleves</em> is a fifteenth-century illuminated manuscript containing a series of some of the most beautiful illustrations of the Bible ever made. Many of the great scenes from the Old Testament and many more from the New Testament are included, besides the Stations of the Cross and portraits of the saints.<br><br> The work of an unidentified Dutch master painter, the manuscript was made for Catherine of Cleves on the occasion of her marriage to the Duke of Guelders. All the 157 surviving miniatures are reproduced to actual size and in exquisite color with gold, together with three samples of pages containing the Latin prayers. Page after page reveals the elaborate program and rich illumination of the original. The progression from beginning to end shows an artist increasing in skill, relying in his earlier work on tradition and later emerging as an independent artist of bold, clear colors, dynamic brushwork, and lively imagination. He stands as one of the supreme painters of fifteenth-century Northern Europe.<br><br> Each page is accompanied by a descriptive and explanatory commentary by John Plummer. His introduction discusses the development of the Book of Hours as a liturgical form in general, and the history of the Cleves Hours specifically, and describes the place it holds in the history of Northern painting. 160 color illustrations with gold embellishment</p><p>John Plummer is a former curator and Research Fellow Emeritus at the Pierpont Morgan Library.

More and more, employees are seeking to understand where their organization is going and to influence the paths taken to get there.</p><p>This shift in the workplace requires a new set of leadership skills.

In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of 'advanced' democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought.</p><p>In <i>Laches, Charmides,</i> and <i>Lysis,</i> Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. <i>Protagoras, Ion,</i> and <i>Meno</i> discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In <i>Gorgias,</i> Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The <i>Apology</i> (not a dialogue), <i>Crito, Euthyphro,</i> and the unforgettable <i>Phaedo</i> relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous <i>Symposium</i> and <i>Phaedrus,</i> written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. <i>Cratylus</i> discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the <i>Republic,</i> concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues <i>Euthydemus</i> deals with philosophy; metaphysical <i>Parmenides</i> is about general concepts and absolute being; <i>Theaetetus</i> reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, <i>Sophist</i> deals with not-being; <i>Politicus</i> with good and bad statesmanship and governments; <i>Philebus</i> with what is good. The <i>Timaeus</i> seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished <i>Critias</i> treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of <i>Laws</i> (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.</p></p><p><p>Robert Gregg Bury (1869&#x2013;1951) was a British clergyman and classical scholar.</p></p><h2>I Am Lazarus (Peter Owen Modern Classic)</h2><p><b>Short stories addressing the surreal realities of mental illness, from an incredible cult writer often compared to Kafka and Woolf</b>&nbsp;The tortured life of Anna Kavan brought her some reward in terms of great pieces of art.

We rarely think of fascism as linked to the essence of monopoly-finance capitalism, operating under the guise of American free-enterprise. But, as Michael Joseph Roberto argues, this is exactly where fascism&#x2019;s embryonic forms began gestating in the United States, during the so-called prosperous 1920s and the Great Depression of the following decade. Drawing from a range of authors who wrote during the 1930s and early 1940s, Roberto examines how the driving force of American fascism comes, not from reactionary movements below, but from the top, namely, Big Business and the power of finance capital. More subtle than its earlier European counterparts, writes Roberto, fascist America&#x2019;s racist, top-down quashing of individual liberties masqueraded as &#x201c;real democracy,&#x201d; &#x201c;upholding the Constitution,&#x201d; and the pressure to be &#x201c;100 Percent American.&#x201d; <br><br><em>The Coming of the American Behemoth</em> is intended as a primer, to forge much-needed discourse on the nature of fascism, and its particular forms within the United States. The book focuses on the role of the capital-labor relationship during the period between the two World Wars, when the United States became the epicenter of the world-capitalist system. Concentrating on specific processes, which he characterizes as terrorist and non-terrorist alike, Roberto argues that the interwar period was a fertile time for the incubation of a protean, more salable form of tyranny &#x2013; a fascist behemoth in the making, whose emergence has been ignored or dismissed by mainstream historians. This book is a necessity for anyone who fears America tipping ever closer, in this era of Trump, to full-blown fascism.</p><p><p><strong>Michael Joseph Roberto</strong> retired in 2016 from the faculty of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the largest historically black educational institution in the United States, where he taught contemporary world history.

In Sabrina Jeffries's follow-up to <i>A Dangerous Love</i>, readers again encounter Lady Helena Laverick, who has committed <i>Mrs. Nunley's Guide to Etiquette for Young Ladies</i> to memory. But even the oh-so-proper Lady Helena can't help but notice Daniel Brennan's impressive dimensions when he answers her knock on his door dressed only in his underwear. What business does a gently reared young lady have with the disreputable son of a highwayman?<p> Only the most dire circumstances could persuade Lady Helena to renew her acquaintance with that scoundrel, but her youngest sister has run away with a fortune hunter and Helena needs Daniel to help her find the young couple before it's too late. As a retired smuggler and Helena's brother-in-law's former man of business, Daniel knows how to get things done and his upbringing makes him ideally suited to this particular mission. Of course, Daniel could travel a lot faster if he didn't have Helena with him--and if he didn't need to fight his attraction to her every step of the way.

BOMC &amp; QPB Feat Alt. Tour.</p><p>"Death changes everything." So begins Dorothy Allison's sprawling, ambitious, and deeply satisfying second novel, <i>Cavedweller</i>. For Delia Byrd, Randall Pritchard's death in a motorcycle accident launches a journey of several thousand miles and almost two decades, a rebirth of sorts that's also a return to her roots. Years before, the handsome but untrustworthy rock star Randall helped Delia flee an abusive husband; Delia escapes physical danger but leaves her two small children behind. In California, her abandoned daughters haunt her dreams and preoccupy her waking hours, even as she sings in Randall's band and gives birth to another daughter, Cissy. But when Randall is killed in a motorcycle accident, Delia packs rebellious Cissy into a broken-down Datsun, bound for Cayro, Georgia, and the one thing that suddenly matters more than anything else: her abandoned children and the chance to be a mother to them once again. <p> Cayro's poverty is emotional as well as material; the town is a hard place, full of hard people. To them, Delia will always be "that bitch" who abandoned her babies, "that hippie" living a life of sin. Nonetheless, Delia forges a cruel bargain with her former husband: in exchange for Delia's agreeing to care for him as he dies, he gives her a chance to reclaim her daughters. Like <i>Bastard out of Carolina</i>, Allison's acclaimed debut novel, <i>Cavedweller</i> is a chronicle of rage, strength, and survival. Here, however, Allison is equally concerned with the redemptive power of love and forgiveness, and a novel that began with death ends on an unexpectedly sanguine note: "'Yes, it's time for some new songs.'" There are no victims in Dorothy Allison's work; Delia triumphs through sheer force of will, bringing her family together despite the contempt of almost everyone around her. </p><p> The novel has its flaws--including occasionally flat-footed prose--but it is in the end compulsively readable, and it's populated by some of the most memorable characters in recent fiction: tough, prickly, flawed, and deeply human, Delia and Cissy are literary creations of the first rank. In describing the complicated emotions that bind and divide them, Allison demonstrates a profoundly unsentimental understanding of the way the human heart works. <i>Cavedweller</i> is the work of a mature artist, her best fiction to date.</p>Dorothy Allison is the bestselling author of several novels including Bastard Out of Carolina, Cavedweller, and Two Or Three Things I Know For Sure, which are available from Brilliance Audio. The recipient of numerous awards, she has been the subject of many profiles and a short documentary film of her life, Two or Three Things but Nothing For Sure.

Then <em>American Idiot</em> debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts, stayed on the charts for nearly 18 months, and went on to sell more than four million records and to win the Grammy for Record of the Year for "Boulevard of Broken Dreams."<br><br> Combining unique access to Green Day with a seasoned journalists nose for a great story, Marc Spitz gives the complete account of the band, from their earliest days to their most recent explosion of popularity and critical acclaim. Foremost, <em>Nobody Likes You</em> is a story of friendship and the transporting power of playing very loud music. It is the story of how high school dropout Billie Joe Armstrong came to write song lyrics that inflamed the political conscience of fans in a way that two Yale graduates couldn't. Green Days story -- from rise, to fall, to rise again -- has never been fully told.</p><p><strong>Marc Spitz</strong> is one of only two senior writers at <em>Spin</em> magazine, and has conducted in-depth interviews with some of the biggest modern cultural icons, including Courtney Love, The Strokes, Nine Inch Nails, and Morrissey. The January 2006 issue, featuring The Killers, will be his 13th <em>Spin</em> cover story. Spitz has also contributed features and reviews to <em>The New York Post</em>, <em>Maxim</em>, <em>Nylon</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, and <em>GQ</em> and has appeared on CNN, VH1, and MTV. He lives in New York City.After years of failing to duplicate its album <i>Dookie</i>'s success, punk-rocking Green Day seemed dead in the water. An undercurrent of critical disdain had always held that the band purveyed punk lite and was an aggregation of poseurs compared to legendary punk outfits the Clash and the Ramones. Then the group's eighth album, <i>American Idiot</i>, hit the top of the charts in 2004 and stayed there, catapulting Green Day back into public attention. Spitz, a senior writer for <i>Spin</i>, sympathetically limns the arc of the lads' career from East Bay, California, in informative if unchallenging style. Probably headed for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame because of their commercial success playing punk, a subgenre that has rarely exerted mass commercial appeal, Green Day deserves representation in rockin' library collections.^B <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

At the start of each chapter, "Following the Themes" introduces the relationship of the chapter&#x2019;s content to each of the themes. At the end of each chapter, "Connecting the Concepts with the Themes" not only reminds the student of the relationships between chapter content and the three core themes, but also acts as a prelude to topics in the next few chapters of the text. In essence, the themes act as the threads that unite the concepts throughout the text, enabling the student to see relationships from the molecular to ecosystem levels of biology.<br></p><p></p><h2>Rhapsody in Schmaltz: Yiddish Food and Why We Can&#39;t Stop Eating It</h2><p><p>Bagels, deli sandwiches and gefilte fish are only a few of the Jewish foods to have crossed into American culture and onto American plates. <i>Rhapsody in Schmaltz </i>traces the history and social impact of the cuisine that Yiddish-speaking Jews from Central and Eastern Europe brought to the U.S. and that their American descendants developed and refined. The book looks at how and where these dishes came to be, how they varied from region to region, the role they played in Jewish culture in Europe, and the role that they play in Jewish and more general American culture and foodways today. </p><p><i>Rhapsody in Schmaltz </i>traces the pathways of Jewish food from the Bible and Talmud, to Eastern Europe, to its popular landing pads in North America today. With an eye for detail and a healthy dose of humor, Michael Wex also examines how these impact modern culture, from temple to television. He looks at Diane Keaton's pastrami sandwich in <i>Annie Hall</i>, Andy Kaufman's stint as Latke on <i>Taxi</i> and Larry David's Passover seder on <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>, shedding light on how Jewish food permeates our modern imaginations.</p><p><i>Rhapsody in Schmaltz </i>is a journey into the sociology, humor, history, and traditions of food and Judaism.</p></p><p>MICHAEL WEX was born in Lethbridge, Alberta and later moved to Toronto. Wex is the also the author of nonfiction books <i>Born to Kvetch, Just Say Nu, </i>and <i>How to Be a Mensch (and Not a Shmuck)</i>, and fiction books <i>The Adventures of Micah Mushmelon, Boy Talmudist; The Frumkiss Family Business; </i>and <i>Shlepping the Exile</i>. He is also well known as a speaker on matters relating to Yiddish language and culture and more general aspects of Judaism. He lives in Toronto with his wife and daughter.<p>&#x201c;Mouth-watering and eye-opening in equal measure &#x2013; <i>Rhapsody in Schmaltz </i>is essential reading for anyone who has shmeared a bagel, trifled with trayf, or hunted the Afikomen.&#x201d; --<b>Ben Schott, author of <i>Schott&#x2019;s Original Miscellany</i></b><br><i><b> </b></i><br><i><b> </b></i>&#x201c;Wex proves once again in Schmaltz that he is Yiddish culture's equivalent of his titular fat; a salve, a balm, the heart, soul, and very <i>tam</i> of the edible delicacies and their origins that he chronicles here. Not since the Rascal House menu was last printed has there been a finer assembly of words on Jewish food upon the page.&#x201d; -<b>-David Sax, author of <i>Save the Deli: In Search of Perfect Pastrami, Crusty Rye, and the Heart of Jewish Delicatessen</i></b></p><p> &#x201c;Only Wex can write an insightful, witty read on the history of Jewish food and its ingredients.

But few say it with Michael Wex's mix of insider's wisdom, great appetite, and even greater humor. <i>Rhapsody in Schmaltz</i> is a masterful work, one I'll turn to over and over for both historical reference and a hearty chuckle.<b>"</b> <b>--Leah Koenig, author of <i>Modern Jewish Cooking</i></b><br><i><b> </b></i><br> &#x201c;I'm typing this blurb with a hot glass of tea and a pletzel to the right of me, so I need to make this quick. Wex has given us a learned examination of the religious whys and wherefores of the food found in North American Polish-Jewish homes (like mine and his) through the 1960s. There are not a few wise cracks mixed in, like onions in kreplach, with all the scholarship.

Wex (How to Be a Mentsh (and Not a Shmuck), 2009, etc.) brings lighthearted humor and his considerable expertise on Jewish culture to a wide-ranging look at Jewish food, from biblical dietary restrictions to New York bagels. An informative, merrily entertaining culinary and cultural history." <b><i>--Kirkus</i></b></p><p> "Only Michael Wex could unravel the delectable mysteries of Ashkenazi cuisine with the precision of a Talmudic commentator and the wit of a Jon Stewart. Here are all the usual suspects--from kasha and knishes to kugels--but their explication comes by way of Chaucer and Ray Charles, Petronius, Pynchon, and Homer Simpson.

In addition, the author explains in this meticulously researched book the reason why Frick and his daughter Helen selected the paintings, sculpture, and other items that are included in the collection.<br> <br>Since 1935 the magnificent art treasures of the Frick Collections have been open to the public in the New York City mansion that the family occupied. This book will enrich any visitor's experience of the Frick Collection in a way that had not been possible in previous books. The intriguing topics covered here include Frick's complex relationship with Andrew Carnegie and with other well-known business magnates; his harsh personal life darkened by the deaths of a younger daughter and infant son; and a sensitive portrayal of his daughter Helen, who was a Frick Collection trustee and chairman of the Art Acquisitions Committee after her father's death.<br> <br>Illustrating this book are 370 pictures ranging from paintings and sculpture in the Frick Collection to family portraits and historical images. This biography of a key figure in the development of American industry will appeal to both art history lovers and to historians, offering a singular and compelling reading and visual experience.<br></p><p>Henry Frick, remembered by art lovers today for his splendid collection of old-master paintings by Rembrandt, Bellini, and others that make up New York's Frick Museum, was one of the 19th century's worst robber barons. Brutal with workers, he never hesitated to hire mercenary armies to kill railway and mine strikers. Frick's was such a bloody and vicious climb to a pot of gold that his descendents have been understandably reluctant to allow historians full access to his papers. Finally, his great-granddaughter, Martha Sanger, a noted steeplechase and hunting enthusiast, decided to write about the life of her ancestor, and was allowed full use of the archives.<p> Sanger's publisher, Abbeville, has done her proud with a luxuriously produced volume in which Sanger offers many theories about why Frick bought certain works of art. And although art historians may dismiss her black-and-white analyses of a collector's motivations--based, as she admits, on her own years in psychoanalysis--they at least reflect how Frick's own family saw him. Among the reproductions are famous pictures by Goya, Greco, and Gainsborough, but also many others rarely reproduced, perhaps because they are typically bad-taste 19th-century art, showing that even Frick bought some duds. Whether or not he acquired paintings, as Sanger asserts, because they reminded him of a daughter who died in early childhood, Frick was still a major historical figure, and his life needs this kind of voluminous treatment in order to complement harsher portraits by professional historians like Samuel Schreiner, who subtitled his own 1995 book from St. Martins Press <i>The Gospel of Greed</i>. <i>--Benjamin Ivry</i></p><b>Martha Frick Symington Sanger</b>, who lives in Maryland, has lectured about Henry Clay Frick, and has served on camera and a a consultant for a public television documentary about Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie.<br></p><h2>To Brew or Not to Brew (A Brewing Trouble Mystery)</h2><p><p><b>An all-new mystery series set in a Pittsburgh craft brew pub, featuring a brewmaster with a head for sleuthing.

I was hoping to brew a batch of pale ale tomorrow, but that was now out of the question.</p><p>The inspector brought me back down to earth. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to schedule another inspection after you get this taken care of.&#x201d;</p><p>This should have been the final plumbing inspection. The brew kettle we&#x2019;d been using had been a hand-me-down from a local brewery that had upgraded their equipment. I hadn&#x2019;t planned on a new brewing tank for another year, but this one had come up at a price I couldn&#x2019;t pass up. Everything else, from the kitchen to the restrooms to the tanks we&#x2019;d installed previously, had all passed weeks ago. I couldn&#x2019;t afford a delay right now. The opening of my brewpub&#x2014;the Allegheny Brew House&#x2014;was only a month away.</p><p>&#x201c;When I call to schedule it, how long will I have to wait until you come out?&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try to get out the same day, but it really depends on how busy I am.&#x201d;</p><p>That eased my mind a little bit&#x2014;provided I could get the plumber in tomorrow to fix it.</p><p>The inspector passed a clipboard to me. &#x201c;I need your signature that you acknowledge that you didn&#x2019;t pass.&#x201d;</p><p>I signed where he indicated.</p><p>He studied my John Hancock. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look like a Max.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d heard that so many times, I&#x2019;d lost count. I couldn&#x2019;t help it that I was born the only girl in my family. I had five older brothers and my parents assumed they&#x2019;d have another boy when I surprised them twenty-nine years ago. My brothers all had normal first names&#x2014;Sean, Patrick, Joseph, James, and Michael. I had no idea why they decided Maximilian would be a good name for a baby. It wasn&#x2019;t even Irish. Anyway, I ended up Maxine, but I preferred plain old Max.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d get that fixed first thing tomorrow if I were you, Miss O&#x2019;Hara.&#x201d;</p><p>As I watched him leave, I fought the urge to beat my head against the steel tank. All I could see were more dollar signs before my eyes. Although my plumber happened to be my brother Michael, he still needed to be paid. I got the family discount, but it was still money I hadn&#x2019;t planned on. Now I was second-guessing my decision to buy this tank.</p><p>&#x201c;Another problem?&#x201d;</p><p>I started at the sound of my assistant&#x2019;s voice behind me. Truth be told, Kurt Schmidt was more than an assistant. I didn&#x2019;t know where I&#x2019;d have been without him. The son of one of my instructors in Munich, he knew just about all there was to know about brewing beer. He was also an accomplished chef who made the best apple strudel I&#x2019;d ever tasted. He was easy on the eyes, too&#x2014;tall, blond, and blue-eyed. There was no romance between us. He was more like my sixth brother, and he was completely devoted to his fianc�e back in Germany. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say so,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a crack in the water line.&#x201d; I showed it to him.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very strange. It wasn&#x2019;t there yesterday,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It should not have split like that. It is not a high-pressure line.&#x201d; He removed his wire-rimmed glasses and examined it closely. &#x201c;Someone cut this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Impossible. No one&#x2019;s been near these tanks except the two of us. It was probably just defective.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you really think Mike would have used a defective pipe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he didn&#x2019;t see it.&#x201d; At this point, I was just relieved it wasn&#x2019;t a line that was turned on all the time. It might have flooded the whole pub.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think that any more than I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no other explanation. Like I said, we&#x2019;re the only ones who have been near it.&#x201d;</p><p>Kurt put his glasses back on. &#x201c;I suppose you still don&#x2019;t believe the loose electric breaker, the broken mirror, the scratched bar top, and the half dozen other little things aren&#x2019;t connected. I&#x2019;m telling you, someone is trying to keep us from opening.&#x201d;</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t the first time I&#x2019;d heard this line of reasoning. Sure there&#x2019;d been some minor annoyances, but they&#x2019;d been bound to happen. Even during construction, things hadn&#x2019;t always gone according to plan. It went with the territory. There were always surprises. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d; I turned and went down the metal stairs of the elevated platform that served to reach the higher sections of the tanks. I&#x2019;d considered installing all the equipment out of sight, but decided half the fun of going to a brewpub was seeing how what you were drinking was made. I wanted a wall of glass, but because of the cost, I&#x2019;d opted for a large window instead. Eventually, I planned to give brewery tours, but that was a long way off.</p><p>I went through the swinging wooden door of the brewery area, crossed the pine-plank floor, and sat down at the oak bar. I couldn&#x2019;t let myself believe we were being sabotaged. If I did, I&#x2019;d be giving in to all those who said I&#x2019;d never succeed in this endeavor. The first time I set eyes on the former Steel City Brewery, I knew it was what I&#x2019;d been waiting for. When I returned to Pittsburgh from Germany after earning my brewmaster certification, I spent months searching for the perfect spot to open my brewpub. It had taken even longer to get financing, even though I had a nice inheritance from my grandmother for a down payment. No one wanted to take a chance on a five-foot-two female brewmaster. I finally found a lender that specialized in financing women entrepreneurs, and the rest, as they say, is history. At least I hoped so.</p><p>Seconds later, Kurt took the stool beside me. &#x201c;It is not a coincidence.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know that,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Explain it, then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t any more than you can. Don&#x2019;t you think if someone was sabotaging us, they&#x2019;d come up with something a little more elaborate? It&#x2019;s been annoying, but it&#x2019;s all fixable. And how are they getting in? None of the doors have been tampered with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t mean anything. Maybe whoever it is has a second career picking locks. At least the alarm company is finishing up soon. Then, when the alarm is set off, you&#x2019;ll see that I&#x2019;m right.&#x201d; Kurt stood. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost five o&#x2019;clock. Why don&#x2019;t you go home? I&#x2019;ll lock up tonight. I want to work on that <i>kirschtorte</i> recipe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s delicious already.&#x201d; My mouth watered just thinking about it.</p><p>Kurt shook his head. &#x201c;Not quite. It tastes like every other chocolate cherry cake. It&#x2019;s missing something. I want it to be perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>If it turned out half as good as the apple strudel, he could do whatever he wanted with it. The kitchen was his domain. I&#x2019;d stick with the beer.</p><p>I took Kurt&#x2019;s advice for a change and left a short time later&#x2014;after I called Mike, who promised to be there bright and early in the morning. Once outside, I turned to admire the building, like I did at least once daily. Sometimes I had to pinch myself to realize that all this really was mine. It was hard to believe that, not long ago, this had been an empty, forlorn shell. The former Steel City Brewery had been bought out by a large conglomerate, and the first thing the big boys did was shut down the Pittsburgh operation. All the equipment was auctioned off, and the buildings had sat empty for several years before the brewing plant itself had burned to the ground.</p><p>The single-story redbrick building, which was now the Allegheny Brew House, had been used as offices for the company. It was at the end of the row of buildings housing various shops and other businesses. It had taken quite a while to tear out everything down to the brick walls. I hoped my patrons would love the exposed brick inside as much as I did. A nice find had been pine-plank floors underneath the industrial linoleum. It had been much cheaper to have them restored than to install new boards.</p><p>Both the brewery and my loft apartment were in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh. Since Children&#x2019;s Hospital had moved from near the University of Pittsburgh in Oakland to the Bloomfield-Lawrenceville border, the area was booming. It was no longer considered a &#x201c;bad&#x201d; neighborhood. Real estate values had skyrocketed, partly because of the medical professionals wanting to move close to work. Developers who bought up all the distressed properties and rehabbed them were likely making a killing on the resale. New shops and caf�s opened constantly. It seemed like every time I walked up Butler Street to head home, I spotted something that hadn&#x2019;t been there the week before. On my block alone, there was a cupcake bakery, a flower shop, several boutiques, a deli, and a coffee shop.</p><p>I was tempted to stop for a treat when I passed the Cupcakes N&#x2019;at bakery next door to the pub, but talked myself out of it. Out of towners always questioned the name of the bakery. The cupcake part they got, but inevitably someone wanted to know what <i>n&#x2019;at</i> meant. I actually looked it up once and found it was short for <i>and all that</i>. Many of the expressions known as &#x201c;Pittsburghese&#x201d; originated with either the Scots-Irish or the Pennsylvania Dutch.</p><p>The owner, baker extraordinaire Candy Sczypinski, had become a good friend and apparently thought she was helping when she brought her creations over for us to sample, but my waistline couldn&#x2019;t handle much more. Between the cupcakes and other goodies, and sampling the menu items Kurt was coming up with, I was going to have to start walking more than just to the brewery and back. I considered joining the new gym a few blocks away, but I didn&#x2019;t know when I&#x2019;d actually have the time to go.</p><p>Instead of a cupcake, I grabbed a turkey sandwich from the deli across the street. The deli was owned by Ken Butterfield, who manned the counter most days, but since it was after five, he was gone for the day. As I climbed the two flights of stairs to my apartment with my low-calorie sandwich in hand, I felt downright virtuous. That feeling was replaced with guilt when I unlocked the door. I&#x2019;d moved here three months ago, but the place was still littered with boxes that I hadn&#x2019;t had time to unpack. I kept telling myself I&#x2019;d get to them tomorrow, but after putting in twelve-hour days at the pub, I was too exhausted to do much of anything else.</p><p>But at least I had furniture. Sort of. Grandma O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s traditional wingback sofa and chairs didn&#x2019;t exactly go with the modern style of the apartment. The dark mahogany end tables didn&#x2019;t match the bleached-oak laminate flooring. Gram&#x2019;s antique dining room set didn&#x2019;t even fit&#x2014;it was stored in my parents&#x2019; basement. It would have looked ghastly with the white cabinets and stainless steel in the kitchen anyway. She always said <i>Beggars can&#x2019;t be choosers</i>, and while I certainly wasn&#x2019;t a beggar, I was glad to have the hand-me-downs whether they matched or not. Besides, it was comforting to have a little part of her with me. I&#x2019;d been in Germany when she passed two years ago, and I still regretted that I hadn&#x2019;t made it home for her funeral, although Gram herself would have been upset with me if I had. A waste of good money, she would have said. She&#x2019;d never squandered so much as a dime. It was thanks to her that I&#x2019;d had a nice down payment for the brewery.</p><p>When I finished eating my sandwich, I sat at the kitchen island and wondered what to do with myself. I wasn&#x2019;t used to this. I reached for the pen and pad beside the phone and made a list of things I had to do over the next week. The plumber was already taken care of. I had to schedule some waitstaff interviews. The alarm company needed to finish and activate the alarm. Kurt had already started training the kitchen staff, so I should probably touch base with how that was going. There were other miscellaneous deliveries that I needed to be present for. I hoped I wasn&#x2019;t forgetting anything.</p><p>The phone rang just then, and I picked it up.</p><p>&#x201c;Wonder of wonders, my baby sister is at home.&#x201d; It was my oldest brother, Sean. Father Sean to his parishioners. Some people thought he had gone into the priesthood because he was the oldest Irish Catholic son, but it was truly a calling for him. He&#x2019;d broken more than a few hearts when he decided on the seminary. We&#x2019;d both inherited Mom&#x2019;s black hair and blue eyes, and they gave him a debonair movie-star look, especially when he wore the collar. If Hollywood ever remade <i>The Bells of St. Mary&#x2019;s</i>, he&#x2019;d be a shoo-in to play Father O&#x2019;Malley. Twelve years my senior, he was my favorite brother, although I&#x2019;d never tell the others that. A little sister had been a novelty to him, and he became my protector from the day Mom and Dad brought me home from the hospital.</p><p>&#x201c;You can always call my cell phone if I&#x2019;m not at home, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I missed you at Mass yesterday,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>He obviously couldn&#x2019;t see me, but I felt my face flush anyway. I would have liked to tell him I went to another parish, but I couldn&#x2019;t very well lie to a priest, even if he was my brother. &#x201c;Sorry about that. I got tied up at the brewery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re working too hard. We missed you at dinner, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Sunday dinner was a long-standing family tradition. Most of the time I loved it. Since three of my five brothers were scattered across the country, Mom liked to keep the rest of us close. I often thought it was because Dad was a police officer. Even though he was a homicide detective now and not on the front lines as much as when he&#x2019;d been in uniform, she still worried. I&#x2019;d already talked to Mom that morning about missing dinner and she understood. At least, she&#x2019;d told me she did.</p><p>&#x201c;With the opening so close, I had a lot to do,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Anything I can do to help? Believe it or not, I haven&#x2019;t forgotten how to wield a hammer or a screwdriver.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let your parishioners know you can do that. You don&#x2019;t want the contributions to drop because they think you don&#x2019;t need to pay a handyman.&#x201d;</p><p>Sean laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for the offer,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;ll be fine if we stay on schedule. I&#x2019;ll be sure to make it to dinner next week.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And Mass, too?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hopefully.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maxie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Sean was the only one who dared call me that. When I was five, I busted the next-door neighbor kid in the chops for doing it. &#x201c;Fine. I&#x2019;ll be there,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Good. I&#x2019;ll see you on Sunday.&#x201d;</p><p>I puttered around for a while and actually cleaned out a few boxes of kitchen items. It was ni...</p></p><h2>A, B, C: Three Short Novels: The Jewels of Aptor, The Ballad of Beta-2, They Fly at Ciron</h2><p><i>A, B, C: Three Short Novels</i> contains the first three novels of Samuel R.

Along the piers <br>the ships return; but sailing I would go <br>through double rings of fire, double fears. <br>So therefore let your bright vaults heave the night <br>about with ropes of wind and points of light <br>and say, as all the rolling stars go, &#x201c;I <br>have stood my feet on rock and seen the sky.&#x201d;<br>--The opening lines of the epic of the conflicts between Leptar and Aptor, by the one-armed poet Geo<br><br>Afterwards, she was taken down to the sea.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t feel too well, so she sat on a rock and scrunched her toes in the wet sand. She looked across the water, hunched her shoulders a little. &#x201c;I think it was pretty awful. I think it was terrible. Why did you show it to me? He was only a boy. What reason could they possibly have had for doing that to him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was just a film. We showed it to you so that you would learn.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it was a film of something that really happened!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It happened several years ago, several hundred miles away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it <i>did</i> happen; you used a tight beam to spy on them, and when the image came in on the vision screen, you made a film of it, and&#x2014;Why did you show it to me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What have we been teaching you?&#x201d;<br><br>But she couldn&#x2019;t think: only the picture in her mind, vivid movements, scarlets, bright agony. &#x201c;He was just a child,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t have been more than eleven or twelve.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>You</i> are a child. You aren&#x2019;t sixteen yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What was I supposed to learn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look around. You should see something.&#x201d;<br><br>But it was still too vivid, too red, too bright. . . . <br><br>&#x201c;You should be able to learn it right here on this beach, in the trees back there, in the rocks down here, in the shells around your feet. You do see it; you don&#x2019;t recognize it.&#x201d; His voice brightened. &#x201c;Actually you&#x2019;re a very fine student. You learn quickly. Do you remember anything from your study of telepathy a month ago?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;By a method similar to radio broadcast and reception,&#x2019; &#x201d; she recited, &#x201c; &#x2018;the synapse patterns of conscious thought are read from one cranial cortex and duplicated in another, resulting in a duplication of sensory impressions experienced&#x2014;&#x2019; But I can&#x2019;t do it, so it doesn&#x2019;t help me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about history, then? You did extremely well in the examination. Does knowing about all the happenings in the world before and after the Great Fire help you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well. It&#x2019;s . . . it&#x2019;s interesting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The film you saw was, in a way, history. That is, it happened in the past.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it was so . . .&#x201d;&#x2014;her eyes beat before the flashing waves&#x2014;&#x201c;horrible!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does history fascinate you only because it&#x2019;s interesting? Don&#x2019;t you ever want to know the reason behind some of the things those people do in your books?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I want to know the reasons! I want to know the reason they nailed that man to the oaken cross. I want to know why they did that to him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A good question . . . Which reminds me: at about the same time they were nailing him to that cross, it was decided in China that the forces of the Universe were to be represented by a circle, half black, half white. To remind themselves, however, that there is no pure force, no single and unique reason, they put a spot of white paint in the black half and a spot of black paint in the white. Interesting?&#x201d;<br><br>She frowned, wondering at the transition. But he was going on:<br><br>&#x201c;And do you remember the goldsmith, the lover, how he recorded in his autobiography that at age four, he and his father saw the Fabulous Salamander on their hearth by the fire; and his father smacked the boy across the room into a rack of kettles, saying something to the effect that little Cellini was too young to remember the incident unless it was accompanied by pain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I remember the story,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And I remember Cellini said he wasn&#x2019;t sure if the smack was the reason he remembered the Salamander&#x2014;or the Salamander the reason he remembered the smack!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes!&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it. The reason, the reasons . . .&#x201d; In his excitement, his hood fell back and she saw his face in the late afternoon&#x2019;s copper light. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you see the pattern?&#x201d;<br><br>Scored forehead, the webbing at his eyes: she traced the pattern of age there, and let her eyes drop. &#x201c;Only I don&#x2019;t know what a Salamander is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like the blue lizards that sing outside your window,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;Only it isn&#x2019;t blue and it doesn&#x2019;t sing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why should anyone want to remember it?&#x201d; She grinned. But he was not looking at her.<br><br>&#x201c;And the painter,&#x201d; he was saying, &#x201c;you remember, in Florence. He was painting a picture of La Gioconda. As a matter of fact, he had to take time from the already crumbling picture of the Last Supper of the man who was nailed to the cross of oak to paint her. And he put a smile on her face of which men asked for centuries, &#x2018;What is the reason she smiles so strangely?&#x2019; Yes, the reason, don&#x2019;t you see? Just look around!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about the Great Fire?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;When they dropped flames from the skies and the harbors boiled; that was reasonless. That was like what they did to that boy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; he said to her. &#x201c;Not reasonless. True, when the Great Fire came, people all over the earth screamed, &#x2018;Why? Why? How can man do this to man? What is the reason?&#x2019; But just look around you, right here! On the beach!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess I can&#x2019;t see it yet,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I can just see what they did to him; and it was awful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well.&#x201d; He pulled together his robe. &#x201c;Perhaps when you stop seeing what they did so vividly, you will start seeing why they did it. I think it&#x2019;s time for us to go back now.&#x201d;<br><br>She slid off the rock and started walking beside him, barefoot in the sand. &#x201c;That boy . . . I wasn&#x2019;t sure, he was all tied up; but&#x2014;he had four arms, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He did.&#x201d;<br><br>She shuddered again. &#x201c;You know, I can&#x2019;t just go around just saying it was awful. I think I&#x2019;m going to write a poem. Or make something. Or both. I&#x2019;ve got to get it out of my head.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That wouldn&#x2019;t be a bad idea,&#x201d; he mumbled as they approached the trees in front of the river. &#x201c;Not bad at all.&#x201d;<br><br>And several days later, several hundred miles away . . . <br><br>CHAPTER ONE<br><br>Waves flung themselves at the blue evening. Low light burned on the hulks of wet ships that slipped by mossy pilings into the docks as water sloshed at the rotten stone embankments.<br><br>Gangplanks, chained to wooden pulleys, scraped into place on concrete blocks; and the crew, after the slow Captain and the tall Mate, loped raffishly along the boards, which sagged with the pounding of bare feet. In bawling groups, pairs, or singly, they howled into the waterfront streets, by the yellow light from inn doors, the purple portals leading to rooms full of smoke and the stench of burnt poppies, laughter, and the sheen on red lips, to the houses of women.<br><br>The Captain, with eyes the color of sea under fog, touched his sword hilt with his fist and said quietly, &#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;ve gone. We better start collecting new sailors for the ten we lost at Aptor. Ten good men, Jordde. I get ill when I think of the bone and broken meat they became.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ten for the dead,&#x201d; sneered the Mate, &#x201c;and twenty for the living we&#x2019;ll never see again. Any sailor that would want to continue this trip with us is crazy. We&#x2019;ll do well if we only lose twenty.&#x201d; He was a wire-bound man, on whom any clothing looked baggy.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never forgive her for ordering us to that monstrous Island,&#x201d; said the Captain.<br><br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t speak too loudly,&#x201d; mumbled the Mate. &#x201c;Yours isn&#x2019;t to forgive her. Besides, she went with them and was in as much danger as they were. It&#x2019;s only luck she came back.&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly the Captain asked, &#x201c;Do you believe the stories of magic they tell of her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, sir?&#x201d; asked the Mate. &#x201c;Do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; The Captain&#x2019;s certainty came too quickly. &#x201c;Still, with three survivors out of thirteen, that she should be among them, with hardly a robe torn . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps they wouldn&#x2019;t touch a woman,&#x201d; suggested Jordde.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; said the Captain.<br><br>&#x201c;And she&#x2019;s been strange ever since then. She walks at night. I&#x2019;ve seen her going by the rails, looking from the seafire to the stars and back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ten good men,&#x201d; mused the Captain. &#x201c;Hacked up, torn in bits. I wouldn&#x2019;t have believed that much barbarity in the world if I hadn&#x2019;t seen that arm, floating on the water. It even chills me now, the way the men ran to the rail, pointed at it. And it just raised itself up, like a sign, then sank in a wash of foam and green water.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said the Mate, &#x201c;we have men to get.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wonder if she&#x2019;ll come ashore?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll come if she wants, Captain. Her doing is no concern of yours. Your job is the ship and to do what she asks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have more of a job than that,&#x201d; and he looked back at his still craft.<br><br>The Mate touched the Captain&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to speak things like that, speak them softly, and only to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have more of a job than that,&#x201d; the Captain repeated. Then suddenly he started away; the Mate followed him down the darkening dockside.<br><br>The wharf was still a moment. Then a barrel toppled from a pile of barrels, and a figure moved like a bird&#x2019;s shadow between two mounds of cargo.<br><br>At the same time two men approached down a street filled with the day&#x2019;s last light. The bigger one threw a great shadow that aped his gesticulating arms on the crowded buildings. His bare feet slapped the cobbles like halved hams. His shins were bound with thongs and pelts. He waved one hand in explanation and rubbed the back of the other on his short mahogany beard. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to ship out, eh, friend? You think they&#x2019;ll take your rhymes and jingles instead of muscles and rope pulling?&#x201d;<br><br>The smaller, in a white tunic looped with a leather belt, laughed in spite of his friend&#x2019;s ranting. &#x201c;Fifteen minutes ago you thought it was a fine idea, Urson. You said it would make me a man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s a life to make&#x201d;&#x2014;Urson&#x2019;s hand went up&#x2014;&#x201c;and it&#x2019;s a life to break men.&#x201d; It fell.<br><br>The slighter one pushed black hair back from his forehead, stopped, and looked at the boats. &#x201c;You still haven&#x2019;t told me why no ship has taken you on in the past three months.&#x201d; Absently he followed the rigging, like black slashes in blue silk. &#x201c;A year ago I&#x2019;d never see you in for more than three days at once.&#x201d;<br><br>The gesticulating arm suddenly encircled the smaller man&#x2019;s waist and lifted a leather pouch from the belt. &#x201c;Are you sure, friend Geo,&#x201d; began the giant, &#x201c;that we couldn&#x2019;t use up some of this silver on wine before we go? If you want to do this right, then right is how it should be done. When you sign up on a ship you&#x2019;re supposed to be broke and tight. It shows you&#x2019;re capable of getting along without the inconvenience of money and can hold your liquor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Urson, get your paw off!&#x201d; Geo pulled the purse away.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, here,&#x201d; countered Urson, reaching for it once more, &#x201c;you don&#x2019;t have to grab.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ve kept you drunk five nights now; it&#x2019;s time to sober up. Suppose they don&#x2019;t take us. Who&#x2019;s going&#x2014;&#x201d; But Urson, laughing, made another swipe.<br><br>Geo leaped back with the purse. &#x201c;Now, cut that out&#x2014;&#x201d; In leaping, his feet struck the fallen barrel. He fell backward to the wet cobbles. The pouch splattered away, jingling.<br><br>They scrambled&#x2014;<br><br>Then the bird&#x2019;s shadow darted between the cargo piles; the slight figure bounded forward, swept the purse up with one hand, pushed himself away from the pile of crates with another; and there were two more pumping at his side as he ran.<br><br>&#x201c;What the devil . . .&#x201d; began Urson, and then: &#x201c;What the <i>devil</i>!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, you!&#x201d; Geo lurched to his feet. &#x201c;Come back!&#x201d;<br><br>Urson had already loped a couple of steps after the fleeing quadrabrad, now halfway down the dock.<br><br>Then, like a wineglass stem snapping, a voice: &#x201c;Stop, little thief. Stop.&#x201d;<br><br>He stopped as though he had hit a wall.<br><br>&#x201c;Come back, now. Come back.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned and docilely started back, his movements, so lithe a moment ago, mechanical now.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a kid,&#x201d; Urson said.<br><br>He was a dark-haired boy, naked except for a ragged breechclout. He was staring fixedly beyond them. And he had four arms.<br><br>Now they turned and looked also.<br><br>She stood on the ship&#x2019;s gangplank, dark against what sun still washed the horizon. One hand held something close at her throat, and the wind, snagging a veil, held the purple gauze against the red swath at the world&#x2019;s edge, then dropped it.<br><br>The boy, automaton, approached her.<br><br>&#x201c;Give it to me, little thief.&#x201d;<br><br>He handed her the purse. She took it. Then she dropped her other hand from her neck. The moment she did so, the boy staggered backward, turned, and ran straight into Urson, who said, &#x201c;Ooof,&#x201d; and then, &#x201c;Goddamned spider!&#x201d;<br><br>The boy struggled like a hydra in furious silence. Urson held. &#x201c;You stick around . . . Owww! . . . to get yourself thrashed . . . there.&#x201d; Urson locked one arm across the boy&#x2019;s chest. With his other hand he caught all four wrists; he lifted up, hard. The thin body shook like wires jerked taut, but the boy was still silent.<br><br>Now the woman came across the dock. &#x201c;This belongs to you, gentlemen?&#x201d; she asked, extending the purse.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; grunted Urson, reaching forward.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; said Geo, intercepting. Then he recited:<br><br>&#x201c;Shadows melt in light of sacred laughter.<br>Hands and houses shall be one hereafter.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he added.<br><br>Beneath the veil her eyebrows raised. &#x201c;You have been schooled in courtly rites?

Her contributions to social theory raise critical questions about women and citizenship, the relations of capitalism and women's oppression, and the differences between a feminist theory that emphasizes women's difference and one that assumes a gender-neutral humanity. </p><p>Loosely following a phenomenological method of description, Young's essays on female embodiment discuss female movement, pregnancy, clothing, and the breasted body.

The text is as he left it. It lacks that final editing that he would have done in proof, but it is substantially a completed, self-contained work. Lograire, as with William Carlos Williams&#x2019;s Paterson, is first of all a country of the imagination, but it is also a person&#x2013;&#x2013;Merton himself&#x2013;&#x2013;for its "geography" is the map, the inner choreography, of his mind. The charting in the poem is his search for self-location: where, and even how, does a man find himself in the geography of all men? Sections of personal experience are set against passages re-imagined from anthropological and historical texts, material that Merton chose for its character of myth to illustrate the general experience of mankind. The myths of Lograire form a mosaic of African legends, Mixtecart motifs and Mayan religious customs, the pantheism of the fanatical Ranters in 17th-century England, the records of an early arctic expedition and of Ibn Battuta, the 14th-century Arab traveler, the Cargo Cults of Melanesia and the Ghost Dances of the American Indians. "A poet," Merton wrote in his prefatory note to Lograire, "spends his life attempting to build or to dream the world in which he lives. But more than that he realizes that this world is at once his and everybody&#x2019;s. It grows out of a common participation which is nevertheless recorded in authentically personal images. I have without scruple mixed what is my own experience with what is almost everybody else&#x2019;s." Many modern poets have used history and myth in their work; what sets&nbsp;<em>The Geography of Lograire</em>&nbsp;apart is the invention of Merton&#x2019;s method&#x2013;&#x2013;his process for elevating fact to the level of myth. It is a complex technique of fractured syntax, multiple meanings; the distortion of dream, irony and parody.</p><p>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) entered the Cistercian Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky, following his conversion to Catholicism and was ordained in 1949. During the 1960s, he was increasingly drawn into a dialogue between Eastern and Western religions and was actively engaged with domestic issues of war and racism.&#x201c;Merton's wisdom literature has taken me into the ultimate cause of things.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sue Monk Kidd</strong></p><h2>Seablindness: How Political Neglect Is Choking American Seapower and What to Do About It</h2><p>The challenges to American security in the Western Pacific, the seas that surround Europe, and the Persian Gulf are growing. At the same time, U.S. military commanders seek more naval forces to protect America's interest in the safe transit of American goods, deterrence in a proliferating world, and the defense of our key allies. At the same time U.S. defense budgets are shrinking. American seapower has not been as small as it is today since before World War I. Unless reversed, U.S. seapower will continue its decline into the indefinite future as politicians ignore the widening gulf between the cost of modernizing and expanding American seapower, and the resources devoted to this most strategic arm of the nation's defense. <i>Seablindness</i> explains the dilemma. It looks at the consequences of neglect including the effect of increased deployments on families, global scenarios set in the immediate future, the views of America's most knowledgeable military officers, the anxious reactions of U.S. allies, and hard facts to show how a lack of political will is dismantling the nation's global reach and with it, our position as the world's great power.<br> <br></p><p>Seth Cropsey served as deputy Undersecretary of the U.S. Navy in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. He was an officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1985 to 2004. Cropsey is a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC and director of Hudson's Center for American Seapower. His previous book, <i>Mayday</i>, published in 2014, examines the history of U.S. naval power, the fate of other maritime states that have given up or lost their power at sea, and policy options for the future.</p><h2>Buccaneers of the Caribbean: How Piracy Forged an Empire</h2><p><p> During the seventeenth century, sea raiders known as buccaneers controlled the Caribbean. Buccaneers were not pirates but privateers, licensed to attack the Spanish by the governments of England, France, and Holland. Jon Latimer charts the exploits of these men who followed few rules as they forged new empires. </p><p> </p><p> Lacking effective naval power, the English, French, and Dutch developed privateering as the means of protecting their young New World colonies. They developed a form of semi-legal private warfare, often carried out regardless of political developments on the other side of the Atlantic, but usually with tacit approval from London, Paris, and Amsterdam. Drawing on letters, diaries, and memoirs of such figures as William Dampier, Sieur Raveneau de Lussan, Alexander Oliver Exquemelin, and Basil Ringrose, Jon Latimer portrays a world of madcap adventurers, daredevil seafarers, and dangerous rogues. </p><p> </p><p> Piet Hein of the Dutch West India Company captured, off the coast of Cuba, the Spanish treasure fleet, laden with American silver, and funded the Dutch for eight months in their fight against Spain. The switch from tobacco to sugar transformed the Caribbean, and everyone scrambled for a quick profit in the slave trade. Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s ludicrous Western Design&#x2014;a grand scheme to conquer Central America&#x2014;fizzled spectacularly, while the surprising prosperity of Jamaica set England solidly on the road to empire. The infamous Henry Morgan conducted a dramatic raid through the tropical jungle of Panama that ended in the burning of Panama City. </p><p> </p><p> From the crash of gunfire to the billowing sail on the horizon, Latimer brilliantly evokes the dramatic age of the buccaneers. </p></p><p>Jon Latimer lectured at the University of Wales, Swansea and served in the Territorial Army. He is the author of 1812: War with America and Alamein (both from Harvard).In the 17th century the legalities of privateering were ever in flux. A pirate one day might receive a royal commission the next, becoming a "privateer" fighting for the crown; it is these privateers-or in England, buccaneers-that are Latimer's focus. Spain was the juggernaut of the era, but swashbuckling seafarers (as well as continental wars and poor colonial management) contributed to the slow diminishment of its power. Recounted here are numerous tales of sieges and nautical battles, daring escapes and surprising disasters, vicious raids, piratical infighting, violent religious tensions, and the political jockeying of European powers struggling for dominance in the New World. Latimer (Alamein) employs clear, spare prose with an eye for the potent detail to accentuate a story. Readers new to the period may struggle to keep track of the players in this detailed account, preferring a more accessible introduction. However, those familiar with the era or seeking an in-depth treatment will delight in this rich history, drawing on remarkable primary sources to make a readable narrative on the exciting age of the buccaneers. 17 pages of color and b&amp;w illus.; 6 maps. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Born in Japan in 1910 and raised in Korea, Yuasa was an eyewitness to the ravages of the Japanese occupation. In both of the novels presented here, he is clearly critical of Japanese imperialism. <i>Kannani</i> (1934) stands alone within Japanese literature in its graphic depictions of the racism and poverty endured by the colonized Koreans. <i>Document of Flames</i> (1935) brings issues of class and gender into sharp focus. It tells the story of Tokiko, a divorced woman displaced from her Japanese home who finds herself forced to work as a prostitute in Korea to support herself and her child. Tokiko eventually becomes a landowner and oppressor of the Koreans she lives amongst, a transformation suggesting that the struggle against oppression often ends up replicating the structure of domination. <p></p><p>In his introduction, Mark Driscoll provides a nuanced and engaging discussion of Yuasa&#x2019;s life and work and of the cultural politics of Japanese colonialism. He describes Yuasa&#x2019;s sharp turn, in the years following the publication of <i>Kannani</i> and <i>Document of Flames</i>, toward support for Japanese nationalism and the assimilation of Koreans into Japanese culture. This abrupt ideological reversal has made Yuasa&#x2019;s early writing&#x2014;initially censored for its anticolonialism&#x2014;all the more controversial. In a masterful concluding essay, Driscoll connects these novels to larger theoretical issues, demonstrating how a deep understanding of Japanese imperialism challenges prevailing accounts of postcolonialism.</p></p><p>&#34;The publication of these translations may well be remembered as an epoch-making event. Mark Driscoll has made a major contribution to our understanding of Japanese modernity in all of its complexity, of postcoloniality as a theoretical concept and political praxis, and of the politics of Asian studies as a discipline. Moreover, he has rescued a nearly forgotten figure whose work speaks a message that--as Driscoll demonstrates so lucidly--needs to be heard by English-speaking readers today.&#34;--Michael K.

He hides behind knowing, ironic statements, which no one grasps and which change nothing. Armand&#x2019;s son joins the Norwegian SAS to fight in the Middle East, despite being specifically warned against such a move by his father, and this leads to catastrophic, heartbreaking consequences.</p><p>Told exclusively in footnotes to an unwritten book, this is Solstad&#x2019;s radically unconventional novel about how we experience the passing of time: how it fragments, drifts, quickens, and how single moments can define a life.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Dag Solstad</strong> (b. 1941) has written nearly thirty books, including <em>Armand V</em> and <em>T Singer</em> (both available from New Directions). Admired worldwide by writers as diverse as Lydia Davis, Geoff Dyer, and Peter Handke, Solstad has won the 2006 Brage Prize, the 1989 Nordic Council&#x2019;s Prize for Literature, and the Norwegian Critic&#x2019;s Prize in 1969, 1992, and 1999.</p><p><strong>Steven T.

Murray is best known for his translations of the Millennium trilogy by Stieg Larsson.</p>&#x201c;The thing about&nbsp;<em>Armand V</em>&nbsp;is that no matter how seemingly irrelevant these tangents are and how miscellaneous is the book&#x2019;s structure, nothing in it feels unimportant. This, for me, is why <em>Armand V</em> succeeds so magnificently.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Veronica Scott Esposito, <em>Literary Hub</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;All of the whispers have been right: Solstad is a vital novelist.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Charles Finch, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Solstad&#x2019;s inventive approach allows him to reflect on the freedom and obligations of the novelist who is tasked with telling someone else&#x2019;s life story. It also inscribes, in the novel&#x2019;s very form, Solstad&#x2019;s way of writing about people who are not quite the protagonists of their own lives...What if a life&#x2015;even an apparently consequential one, like an ambassador&#x2019;s&#x2015;had no discernible narrative, no coherent main action? Actual lives look nothing much like conventional novels. That is the challenge Solstad accepts and rigorously joins.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Wood, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Death occupies the space between each of the footnotes that make up the corpus of&nbsp;<em>Armand V</em>, but what Solstad ultimately celebrates in it is the freedom of the novelist, and of the novel form, even as the soon-to-be-curtailed lives of his aging protagonists deny freedom&#x2019;s very existence. It is a grand negation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Times Literary Supplement</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Since he published his first book of stories in 1965, Dag Solstad has been to Scandinavian literature what Philip Roth has been to American letters or Gu�nter Grass to German writing: an unavoidable voice.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Paris Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a kind of surrealistic writer&#x2015;serious literature.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Haruki Murakami</strong><br><br>&#x201c;His language sparkles with its new old-fashioned elegance, and radiates a unique luster, inimitable and full of e�lan.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Karl Ove Knausgaard</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Of diplomacy and its discontents: an existentialist-tinged character study by acclaimed Norwegian novelist Solstad.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This unique, fascinating novel is composed of footnotes to a larger work that doesn&#x2019;t exist...Solstad is, as ever, excellent at mingling the personal with the theoretical, embedded in the strange beauty of everyday routine.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The Solstadian long sentence feeds back into itself, meandering with the aimless inevitability of a river heading towards the sea.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong></p><h2>A Change of Heart: A Memoir</h2><p>After a heart and lung transplant operation, dancer Claire Sylvia discovered that new organs were not the only thing she inherited.

Its soldiers would go on to fight with extraordinary bravery and élan in almost every major engagement fought by the British Army during this period, from the American War of Independence, the Peninsular Wars, Waterloo, the Crimea, Indian Mutiny to Egypt and the Sudan. <br><br>Drawing on diaries, letters and memoirs, Victoria Schofield skilfully weaves the multiple strands of this story into an epic narrative of a valiant body of officers and men over one-and-a-half centuries. In her sure hands, the story of The Black Watch is no arid recitation of campaigns, dates and battle honours, but is instead a rich and compelling record of the soldier's experience under fire and on campaign. It is also a celebration of the deeds of a regiment that has played a unique role in British history and a vivid insight into the lives of the many remarkable figures who have marched and fought so proudly under its Colours.</p><p>As a historian and independent commentator on international affairs, with specialist knowledge of South Asia, Victoria Schofield&#39;s other books include Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War and Afghan Frontier: at the Crossroads of Conflict.

Drawing on those talks, this new book reveals the deep turmoil and sometimes chaotic inner life of a man who has become an icon of compassion and vulnerability - for Christians and non-Christians alike.</p><p>Nouwen writes eloquently about calling and purpose, fear and hope. He explains why, with so many choices available to twenty-first-century seekers, the greatest reward for those looking for spiritual direction is rediscovering Jesus' teaching on love. Along the way, Nouwen offers warm, discerning, practicable habits to help readers navigate the narrow, sometimes arduous, but ultimately fulfilling road of conviction and faith.</p><p>'Timeless wisdom for life from one of the great spiritual masters of our age.' <br><b>James Martin </b></p><p><b>'</b>Few writers have influenced me more than Henri Nouwen.

Upon this Earth we experience the effects of Duality, and eventually find our way back to whence we came. The journey has been difficult, but having finally passed the marker we are now in Ascension status and on our way home. The rate at which one ascends depends on one&#x2019;s free will and intent. Quan Yin Speaks serves as a reference book, describing in simple detail, not only the work required, but the physical, mental and spiritual changes that one can expect to experience in the path of evolution towards Enlightenment.

Eng investigates the emergence of &#x201c;queer liberalism&#x201d;&#x2014;the empowerment of certain gays and lesbians in the United States, economically through an increasingly visible and mass-mediated queer consumer lifestyle, and politically through the legal protection of rights to privacy and intimacy. Eng argues that in our &#x201c;colorblind&#x201d; age the emergence of queer liberalism is a particular incarnation of liberal freedom and progress, one constituted by both the racialization of intimacy and the forgetting of race. Through a startling reading of <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, the landmark legal decision overturning Texas&#x2019;s antisodomy statute, Eng reveals how the ghosts of miscegenation haunt both <i>Lawrence </i>and the advent of queer liberalism.<p></p><p>Eng develops the concept of &#x201c;queer diasporas&#x201d; as a critical response to queer liberalism. A methodology drawing attention to new forms of family and kinship, accounts of subjects and subjectivities, and relations of affect and desire, the concept differs from the traditional notions of diaspora, theories of the nation-state, and principles of neoliberal capitalism upon which queer liberalism thrives. Eng analyzes films, documentaries, and literature by Asian and Asian American artists including Wong Kar-wai, Monique Truong, Deann Borshay Liem, and Rea Tajiri, as well as a psychoanalytic case history of a transnational adoptee from Korea. In so doing, he demonstrates how queer Asian migrant labor, transnational adoption from Asia, and the political and psychic legacies of Japanese internment underwrite narratives of racial forgetting and queer freedom in the present. A focus on queer diasporas also highlights the need for a poststructuralist account of family and kinship, one offering psychic alternatives to Oedipal paradigms. <i>The Feeling of Kinship </i>makes a major contribution to American studies, Asian American studies, diaspora studies, psychoanalysis, and queer theory.</p></p><p>&#34;Spanning psychoanalysis, law, and aesthetics, and reading richly and with passion, David L. Eng&#39;s &#34;The Feeling of Kinship&#34; looks at transnational adoption as an exemplary scene of contemporary intimacy in the United States. This is a fearless book that knows and feels what it means to have to defend oneself from the &#39;liberal&#39; place in which one lives; what it means racially, sexually, and legally to have to be defensive in a nation that identifies itself with freedom.&#34;--Lauren Berlant, author of &#34;The Female Complaint: The Unfinished Business of Sentimentality in American Culture&#34;<p>David L.

A sensitive way to acquaint young children with the important life lessons and values inherent in the Bible. Perfect for adults and children to read aloud together.</p></p><p>The brief "Introduction to the Bible" as well as "Who's Who" at the back of the book offer some helpful orientation to these 13 Old and New Testament classics--from Genesis and Noah to the Three Wise Men and the Last Supper. Each story is amply illustrated with watercolors by Julie Downing, and the artwork breaks up the text in unpredictable ways--in other words, you'll find the usual DK Publishing eye for good design. Mary Hoffman's tone is undogmatic (the Bible is simply "some of the best stories ever told") and she is particularly good at finding ways to handle stories, such as Abraham and Isaac, or the crucifixion, that might seem rough-going for children. (Ages 4 to 7) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Kindergarten-Grade 2?Profusely illustrated with lively, slightly childlike watercolors of various sizes that divide the blocks of easy-to-read text, these stories are told in shortened, simplified forms adequate for an introductory collection. Old Testament selections include the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah, Abraham, Joseph, baby Moses, Daniel, and Jonah. The New Testament retellings include the Nativity, the Flight into Egypt, the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection.

All she wants is for life to get back to normal, but normal is looking hard to come by. She&#39;s thirty-eight and hobbles with a cane. Her first student interaction ends in tears (hers). Her fellow faculty members seem uncomfortable with her, and her ex--whom she may or may not still love--has moved on. Enter Nathaniel Barber, a graduate student obsessed with Chicago&#39;s violent history. Nath is a serious scholar, but also a serious mess about his first heartbreak, his mother&#39;s death, and his father&#39;s disapproval. Assigned as Amelia&#39;s teaching assistant, Nath also takes on the investigative legwork that Amelia can&#39;t do. And meanwhile, he&#39;s hoping she&#39;ll approve his dissertation topic, the reason he came to grad school in the first place: the student attack on Amelia Emmet. Together and at cross-purposes, Amelia and Nathaniel stumble toward a truth that will explain the attack and take them both through the darkest hours of their lives.</p><p>Lori Rader-Day, author of The Black Hour and Little Pretty Things, is a two-time Mary Higgins Clark Award nominee and the recipient of the 2014 Anthony Award for Best First Novel.

It sought to communicate the Gospel's perennial newness to the contemporary world in a spirit of joy and hope. Yet despite the exhortations of Paul VI and John Paul II, a number of ecclesial and cultural factors deflected the church's evangelical energies, so that the council's radiant Christocentric vision faded in an increasingly polarized church.</p><p>In this important new work, Robert Imbelli probes the council's comprehensive Christocentric vision and its evangelical imperative. It maintains that Jesus Christ cannot be separated from his body, the church, and that the Eucharist effects the ongoing intimate communion between Head and members. It is this life-giving communion that the church desires to share with the wider world as the world's truth and salvation. Drawing on the writings of Pope Benedict and the witness of Pope Francis, Imbelli's insights will help transform what is merely notional for the reader into a vivid reality through the lure of beauty. Includes four-color illustrations.</p></p><p>Robert P. Imbelli, a priest of the Archdiocese of New York, has taught at the New York Archdiocesan Seminary and at the Maryknoll School of Theology, and from 1986 to 2013 he taught systematic theology at Boston College. He is currently associate professor emeritus. His work appears frequently in journals and magazines such as Theological Studies, The Thomist, Pro Ecclesia, Communio, Worship, Origins, Commonweal, America, and L&#39;Osservatore Romano.Drawing on sources artistic, literary, spiritual, and theological, Robert Imbelli provides a splendid and intellectually stimulating exploration of the New Evangelization. Anyone interested in preaching, teaching, or pastoral work should read this uplifting book.Very Reverend Robert Barron, Rector / President, University of Saint Mary of the Lake / Mundelein Seminary, Mundelein, Illinois<br><br>By careful scriptural exegesis Robert Imbelli properly places Christ at the center of our Christian faith and lives, governing the identity, mission, and worship of the church. All this is illustrated from Christian poetry and art over the centuries in such a way as to encourage and inspire in a freshly imagined way the new evangelization that the Second Vatican Council saw to be sorely needed in our time and world. <i>Rekindling the Christic Imagination </i>could serve in a classic way the theological education of candidates for the priesthood as well as refreshing those already in the ministry (including Protestants!).Dr. Geoffrey Wainwright, Robert Earl Cushman Professor Emeritus of Christian Theology, Duke Divinity School<br><br>Here is clear and beautiful writing at a peaceful pace and tone. With quiet confidence Robert Imbelli places the concept of revelation, especially in its fresh articulation in Vatican II's <i>Dei Verbum</i>, at the center of the theological enterprise. And as the center of revelation he places with renewed clarity the figure of Jesus Christ. This is a model of how to advance theological thinking in the coming years. Faith, wonder, and adoration accompany sharp critical thought in exposing the uniqueness of the treasure given us by God in Jesus Christ.Jeremy Driscoll, OSB, Pontifical Athenaeum Sant' Anselmo, Rome/Mount Angel Seminary<br><br>I had the good fortune of reading Fr. Imbelli's book right before Christmas. The small but rich book proved to be a most rewarding meditation on the surpassing mystery of the incarnation-theologically fecund, spiritually edifying, and aesthetically appealing. The content, style, and artistic appeal of the book gives tangible witness to the fact that truth, goodness, and beauty are united in the person of the crucified and risen Christ. Fr. Imbelli's very accessibly written "mystagogy" is a compelling invitation into the mystery of Christ and an important contribution to the New Evangelization.Reinhard H�tter, Professor of Christian Theology, Duke University Divinity School<br><br>Imbelli doesn't just talk about mystagogy; he practices it. Drawing on poets and painters, <i>Rekindling the Christic Imagination</i> aims for the reader to be `possessed' by Christ. Imbelli rightly refuses to choose between <i>aggiornamento </i>and <i>ressourcement</i>, recognizing that their unity is found in a renewed focus on Jesus Christ himself as the center of our theological endeavors. The result is a biblically grounded and theologically rich meditation on Christological, trinitarian, eucharistic, and ecclesial themes.Hans Boersma, J. I. Packer Professor of Theology, Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada<br><br>Painters and poets help Imbelli distill decades of preaching and teaching into a fine evangelical wine. Charles Taylor's call to recover a sense of what the incarnation can mean inspires an accessible and moving account of church, eucharist, and Vatican II as Christic calls to holiness in the world. A meditative gem of a book!William L. Portier, Mary Ann Spearin Chair of Catholic Theology, University of Dayton<br><br>Robert Imbelli not only has the right ideas but is pitch perfect in delivering the message and helping me to pray as I read. People talk often about theology and aesthetics; I often think some of them have never been truly moved by beauty. By contrast, Imbelli's text is simply beautiful, and the way the art is embedded makes it come alive. Liturgical Press has done a wonderful job with the entire design, from the typography to the hue and texture of the paper, the feel of the cover. Bravo!<br> William R. Burrows, STL, PhD, Managing Editor Emeritus, Orbis Books, Research Professor of Missiology in the World Christianity Program, New York Theological Seminary<br><br>This is a beautiful, profound, and precise book. Theology, for Imbelli, is a matter of meditative, Christ-centered reasoning, and he shows what this means by responding to Christ as imaged by and present in four works of visual art. This way of working gives to Imbelli's prose and pattern of thought a limpidity through which the face of Jesus can be seen in chiaroscuro. It also makes possible a depth of theological thinking that undercuts and reconciles the tired divisions in the American church. I read Imbelli's book immediately after reading Pope Francis' <i>Evangelii Gaudium,</i> and what Imbelli does exemplifies what Francis recommends: a recovery of the joy of thinking about and approaching Jesus that transcends internal oppositions and permits <i>ressourcement</i> and <i>aggiornamento</i> to kiss. Imbelli's work is theological mystagogy of a very high order.Paul J.

The heifer was as range wild as any Garret had seen, but he and old Buck had been herding cows together for many years. They weren&#x2019;t about to be outsmarted by beef on the hoof. Ten minutes later he had the calf roped, hog-tied, and ready for branding. While Jake Whitaker, his hired hand, brought the hot iron from the fire, Garret removed his hat and wiped the sweat from his forehead. Then he reached for his canteen. Tipping back his head, he took a long swallow, washing down the dust. Man alive, it was hot for May. He hoped they weren&#x2019;t in for a long, dry summer. The cattle had wintered well, and Garret was looking forward to turning a nice profit come fall. But a drought could quickly change the face of things. "Always somethin&#x2019;," he muttered as he screwed the cap back on the canteen. The stench of singed hair and flesh reached his nostrils, reminding him of the work still to be done before sundown. Tugging his hat low on his forehead with one hand, he stepped into the saddle. As soon as Jake freed the newly branded calf_--still bleating its complaint--Garret dragged his lariat into a large coil against his thigh, then turned Buck toward the herd. A sense of satisfaction swelled in Garret&#x2019;s chest as his gaze swept the range. Satisfaction was what he always felt when he looked at what he&#x2019;d accomplished in the past eighteen years. He&#x2019;d been nothing but a scrawny kid, still wet behind the ears, when he&#x2019;d come to Montana, when he&#x2019;d first laid eyes on this stretch of land and known he wanted to call it home. He&#x2019;d seen plenty of hard times while he&#x2019;d built his herd from a few head to its present size. And he&#x2019;d seen plenty of changes come to Montana, too. The railroad crawling across the plains and through the mountain passes. The coming of barbed wire. The town of New Prospects, popping up ten miles to the south of the Steele ranch, seemingly overnight. Yeah, things were different, but this was where he belonged. It was his home. "Pa! Pa!" He reined in, twisting in the saddle to watch the approach of his daughter. Janie&#x2019;s wild strawberry blond hair waved behind her like a banner, and her dress was bunched up around her thighs as she raced her pony toward him. Wouldn&#x2019;t Muriel have a fit if she could see Janie now? His teeth clenched as he shoved away thoughts of his dead wife. Sliding her small bay mare to a halt, Janie said, "I finished the dishes and my lessons, Pa. Can I help now?" He grinned even as he shook his head. "You know how I feel about you bein&#x2019; out here while we&#x2019;re branding. This is no place for a little girl." "I&#x2019;m not so little I can&#x2019;t help." He recognized the stubborn set of her jaw. And what she said was true. Janie had taken care of many of the household chores since long before her mother passed away. She&#x2019;d even learned to cook, at least well enough to keep the two of them from starving. But that didn&#x2019;t mean she belonged in the middle of a herd of cattle at branding time. It was too dangerous, and Garret would never risk harm to his daughter. Not ever. "Sorry, Janie. You know the rules." "But, Pa--" "Janie ..." She scowled, her bottom lip protruding in an artful pout. "It&#x2019;s not fair." He was unmoved by her theatrics. "Things rarely are." "Can&#x2019;t I just--" "Nope." He jerked his head toward the ranch house. "You get on back. I&#x2019;ll be finished in about an hour." Janie hesitated only a moment, then, with a deep sigh of the oppressed, turned her pony toward the house and rode slowly away. His daughter would probably never know how hard it was for Garret to refuse anything she asked. He&#x2019;d try to rope her the moon if she wanted it. With a shake of his head, he nudged Buck with his heels and set off to rope the last of the calves instead. Two hours later father and daughter sat down at the rough-hewn table in the log house they called home. Janie said the blessing over the steaks that had been fried with onions and potatoes, and Garret added his own "Amen" to hers when she was finished. "I got another letter from England today," Janie said as she cut her meat, "but it took longer&#x2019;n usual getting here. Lady Elizabeth must already be married to Lord Altberry by now. I hope she&#x2019;ll write again soon and tell me about the wedding and the house where she&#x2019;s living." Garret listened to the excitement in her voice, while feeling residual anger stirring to life. He hated it when Janie talked about England and the Wellingtons. He hated the way she fantasized about traveling abroad someday, and he blamed his deceased wife for putting the notion in Janie&#x2019;s head to begin with. It was Muriel who had encouraged their daughter--only six years old at the time--to write to the earl, an old friend of Garret&#x2019;s father-in-law. It was Muriel who had encouraged the continuing correspondence between Janie and the earl&#x2019;s daughter, and Muriel who had suggested Janie might one day go to England to visit Lady Elizabeth, perhaps to become her companion. It was Muriel who had dreamed of Janie marrying an English lord, like those eastern society women they&#x2019;d read about in the newspaper.</p><h2>Batfishing In The Rainforest</h2><p>Readers familiar with Randy Wayne White's "Out There" column in Outside magazine will relish this first collection of his best work; those new to White's delectable blend of adventure, hilarity, and spirit can only be envied for the satisfaction of that first encounter. <br><br>Whether it&#x2019;s &#x2018;This Dog Is Legend,&#x201d; in which he tells of his cinder-block-retrieving Chesapeake Bay retriever named Gator, or &#x201c;Coming To America,&#x201d; about the stirring&#x2014;and sometimes terrifying&#x2014;Mariel boat lift, White never fails to engross us in a life of sun, boats, work, and sport.<br><br></p><p><b>Randy Wayne White</b>, a former fly-fishing guide whose "Out There" column ran for many years in <i>Outside </i>magazine, currently writes a monthly column for <i>Men's Health</i> magazine.

By using firsthand accounts by the people of Bikini describing their half-century of nuclear exodus, this important book journeys through the Marshallese and Bikinian cultures from ancient to modern times. &#x201c;I thoroughly enjoyed the book, particularly reading the history of Bikini in the words of the people. The book assures that these traditional stories will be available for others to read, but perhaps most importantly, for younger generations of islanders.&#x201d; -Allen P. Stayman U.S. Compact of Free Association Negotiator 1999-2001. &#x201c;FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND is a compelling account of the troubled history of the people of Bikini Atoll. Niedenthal&#x2019;s skillful use of oral history enables the Bikinians to tell much of their own story, and his personal reflections about that history and his own involvement with the community enrich the account. A welcome and useful contribution to Pacific Islands studies.&#x201d; -Robert C. Kiste, Director Center for Pacific Islands Studies University of Hawai'i "Although Niedenthal peppers the book with his own insights and commentary, it is the words of Bikini elders that tell their story of how 23 American nuclear tests disrupted their lives beginning in 1946." -Pacific Islands Magazine, March 2002 "For the Good of Mankind is a remarkably unique book..." -International Monitor Institute, May 2002 "Jack Niedenthal's work is a labor of love..." -The Contemporary Pacific magazine, Fall 2003 "[For the Good of Mankind] is probably the most complete history of Bikini Island, and will continue to be a reference touchstone for future studies of the Marshall Islands and even the south Pacific...The cultural observations are superb." -Nick Wreden, Peace Corp Writers Magazine, January 2004</p><p>Having lived, studied and worked in the Marshall Islands from 1981 until the present, author Jack Niedenthal speaks fluent Marshallese.

Even at that amazingly young age, I still realized that I should write about something I knew.

Drawing on a vast array of sources, this book builds a complete picture of bamboo in both history and our modern world. Susanne Lucas shows how bamboo has always met the physical and spiritual requirements of humanity while at the same time being exploited by people everywhere.&nbsp;Lucas describes how bamboo&#x2019;s special characteristics, such as its ability to grow quickly and thus be an easily replaced resource, offers potential solutions to modern ecological dilemmas. She explores the vital role bamboo plays in the survival of many animals and ecosystems, as well as its use for some of the earliest books ever written, as the framework for houses, and for musical instruments. As modern research and technologies advance, she explains, bamboo use has increased dramatically&#x2014;it can now be found in the filaments of light bulbs, airplanes, the reinforcements of concrete, and even bicycles.

From its early beginnings, to the diverse role bamboo has played in food, horticulture, navigation, and architecture, the author takes us on a delightful journey through bamboo&#x2019;s majestic history. Complementing this colourful work is an assortment of photographs and illustrations, leading us through a curiosity shop of facts and timelines, and it is from these we sense the passion the author has for her subject . . .

The sound of her running shoes urgent on the broad footpath&#x2019;s gravel.<br>&nbsp;<br>At this moment, as the sun&#x2019;s rays pick her out like a searchlight against the mountain, she is the image of carefree grace. Seen from behind, her dark plait bounces against the little rucksack. Her neck is deeply tanned against the powder blue of her T-shirt. There is energy in the rhythmic stride of her long legs in denim shorts. She personifies athletic youth &#x2013; vigorous, healthy, focused.<br>&nbsp;<br>Until she stops and looks back over her left shoulder. Then the illusion disintegrates. There is anxiety in her face. And utter exhaustion.<br>&nbsp;<br>She does not see the impressive beauty of the city in the rising sun&#x2019;s soft light. Her frightened eyes search wildly for movement in the tall <i>fynbos </i>shrubbery behind her. She knows they are there, but not how near. Her breath races &#x2013; from exertion, shock and fear. It is adrenaline, the fearsome urge to live, that drives her to run again, to keep going, despite her aching legs, the burning in her chest, the fatigue of a night without sleep and the disorientation of a strange city, a foreign country and an impenetrable continent.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ahead of her the path forks. Instinct spurs her to the right, higher, closer to the Lion&#x2019;s rocky dome. She doesn&#x2019;t think, there is no plan. She runs blindly, her arms the pistons of a machine, driving her on.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Detective Inspector Benny Griessel was asleep.<br>&nbsp;<br>He dreamed he was driving a huge tanker on a downhill stretch &nbsp;of the N1 between Parow and Plattekloof. Too fast and not quite incontrol. When his cell phone rang, the first shrill note was enough to draw him back to reality with a fl eeting feeling of relief. He opened his eyes and checked the radio clock. It was 05:37.<br>&nbsp;<br>He swung his feet off the single bed, dream forgotten. For an instant he perched motionless on the edge, like a man hovering on a cliff. Then he stood up and stumbled to the door, down the wooden stairs to the living room below, to where he had left his phone last night. His hair was unkempt, too long between trims. He wore only a pair of faded rugby shorts. His single thought was that a call at this time of the morning could only be bad news.<br>&nbsp;<br>He didn&#x2019;t recognise the number on the phone&#x2019;s small screen.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Griessel,&#x2019; his voice betrayed him, hoarse with the first word of the day.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Hey, Benny, it&#x2019;s Vusi.

Another tramp who had drunk too much of something or other. He put the phone down beside his brand new second-hand laptop.<br>&nbsp;<br>He turned, still half asleep, and bashed his shin against the front wheel of the bicycle leaning against his pawnshop sofa. He grabbed it before it toppled. Then he went back upstairs. The bicycle was a vague reminder of his financial difficulties, but he didn&#x2019;t want to dwell on that now.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the bedroom he took off his shorts and the musky scent of sex drifted up from his midriff.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fuck.<br>&nbsp;<br>The knowledge of good and evil suddenly weighed heavily on him. Along with the events of the previous night, it squeezed the last remaining drowsiness from his brain. Whatever had possessed him?<br>&nbsp;<br>He tossed the shorts in an accusatory arc onto the bed and walked through to the bathroom.<br>&nbsp;<br>Griessel lifted the toilet lid angrily, aimed and peed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Suddenly she was on the tar of Signal Hill Road and spotted the woman and dog a hundred metres to the left. Her mouth shaped a cry, two words, but her voice was lost in the rasping of her breath.<br>&nbsp;<br>She ran towards the woman and her dog. It was big, a Ridgeback. The woman looked about sixty, white, with a large pink sun hat, a walking stick and a small bag on her back.<br>&nbsp;<br>The dog was unsettled now. Maybe it smelled her fear, sensed the panic inside her. Her soles slapped on the tar as she slowed. She stopped three metres from them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Help me,&#x2019; said the girl. Her accent was strong.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x2019; There was concern in the woman&#x2019;s eyes. She stepped back. The dog growled and strained on the lead, to get closer to the girl.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re going to kill me.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>The woman looked around in fear. &#x2018;But there&#x2019;s nobody.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>The girl looked over her shoulder. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re coming.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Then she took the measure of the woman and dog and knew they wouldn&#x2019;t make any difference. Not here on the open slope of the mountain. Not against them. She would put them all in danger.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Call the police. Please. Just call the police,&#x2019; she said and ran again, slowly at first, her body reluctant. The dog lunged forward and barked once. The woman pulled back on the lead.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;But why?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Please,&#x2019; she said and jogged, feet dragging, down the tar road towards Table Mountain. &#x2018;Just call the police.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She looked back once, about seventy paces on. The woman was still standing there bewildered, frozen to the spot.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Benny Griessel fl ushed the toilet and wondered why he hadn&#x2019;t seen last night coming. He hadn&#x2019;t gone looking for it, it had just happened. <i>Jissis</i>, he shouldn&#x2019;t feel so guilty, he was only human after all.<br>&nbsp;<br>But he was married.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you could call it a marriage. Separate beds, separate tables and separate homes. Damn it all, Anna couldn&#x2019;t have everything. She couldn&#x2019;t throw him out of his own house and expect him to support two households, expect him to be sober for six fucking months, and celibate on top of that.<br>&nbsp;<br>At least he was sober. One hundred and fifty-six days now. More than five months of struggling against the bottle, day after day, hour after hour, till now.<br>&nbsp;<br>God, Anna must never hear about last night. Not now. Less than a month before his term of exile was served, the punishment for his drinking. If Anna found out, he was fucked, all the struggle and suffering for nothing.<br>&nbsp;<br>He sighed and stood in front of the mirrored cabinet to brush his teeth. Had a good look at himself. Greying at the temples, wrinkles at the corner of his eyes, the Slavic features. He had never been much of an oil painting.<br>&nbsp;<br>He opened the cabinet and took out toothbrush and toothpaste.<br>&nbsp;<br>Whatever had she seen in him, that Bella? There had been a moment last night when he wondered if she was sleeping with him because she felt sorry for him, but he had been too aroused, too bloody grateful for her soft voice and big breasts and her mouth, <i>jissis</i>, that mouth, he had a thing about mouths, that&#x2019;s where the trouble had started. No. It had begun with Lize Beekman, but like Anna would believe that?<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Jissis</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>Benny Griessel brushed his teeth hurriedly and urgently. Then he jumped under the shower and opened the taps on full, so he could wash all the accusing scents from his body.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It wasn&#x2019;t a <i>bergie</i>. Griessel&#x2019;s heart skipped a beat as he climbed over the spiked railings of the church wall and saw the girl lying there. The running shoes, khaki shorts, orange camisole and the shape of her arms and legs told him she was young. She reminded him of his daughter.<br>&nbsp;<br>He walked down the narrow tarmac path, past tall palms and pine trees and a yellow notice board: STRICTLY AUTHORISED. CARS ONLY. AT OWNER&#x2019;S OWN RISK, to the spot just left of the pretty grey church where, on the same tar, she lay stretched out.<br>&nbsp;<br>He looked up at the perfect morning. Bright, with hardly any wind, just a faint breeze bearing fresh sea scents up the mountain. It was not a time to die.<br>&nbsp;<br>Vusi stood beside her with Thick and Thin from Forensics, a police photographer and three men in SAPS uniform. Behind Griessel&#x2019;s back on the Long Street pavement there were more uniforms, at least four in the white shirts and black epaulettes of the Metro Police, all very self-important. Together with a group of bystanders they leaned their arms on the railings and stared at the motionless figure.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Morning, Benny,&#x2019; said Vusi Ndabeni in his quiet manner. He was of the same average height as Griessel, but seemed smaller. Lean and neat, the seams of his trousers sharply pressed, snow-white shirt with tie, shoes shined. His peppercorn hair was cut short and shaved in sharp angles, goatee impeccably clipped. He wore surgical rubber gloves. Griessel had been introduced to him for the first time last Thursday, along with the other five detectives he had been asked to &#x2018;mentor&#x2019; throughout the coming year. That was the word that John Africa, Regional Commissioner: Detective Services and Criminal Intelligence, had used. But when Griessel was alone in Africa&#x2019;s office it was &#x2018;We&#x2019;re in the shit, Benny. We fucked up the Van der Vyver case, and now the brass say it&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;ve just been having too much of a good time in the Cape and it&#x2019;s time to pull finger, but what can I do? I&#x2019;m losing my best people and the new ones are clueless, totally green. Benny, can I count on you?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>An hour later he was in the Commissioner&#x2019;s large conference room, along with six of the best &#x2018;new&#x2019; people looking singularly unimpressed, all seated in a row on grey government-issue chairs. This time John Africa toned down his message: &#x2018;Benny will be your mentor. He&#x2019;s been on the Force for twenty-five years; he was part of the old Murder and Robbery when most of you were still in primary school. What he&#x2019;s forgotten, you still have to learn. But understand this: he&#x2019;s not here to do your work for you. He&#x2019;s your advisor, your sounding board. And your mentor. According to the dictionary that is,&#x2019; the Commissioner glanced at his notes, &#x2018;. . . a wise and trusted counsellor or teacher. That&#x2019;s why I transferred him to the Provincial Task Force. Because Benny is wise and you can trust him, because I trust him. Too much knowledge is being lost, there are too many new people and we don&#x2019;t have to reinvent the wheel every time. Learn from him. You have been hand picked &#x2013; not many will get this opportunity.&#x2019; Griessel watched their faces. Four lean black men, one fat black woman, and one broad-shouldered coloured detective, all in their early thirties. There was not much ungrudging gratitude, with the exception of Vusumuzi (&#x2018;but everyone calls me Vusi&#x2019;) Ndabeni. The coloured detective, Fransman Dekker, was openly antagonistic. But Griessel was already accustomed to the undercurrents in the new SAPS. He stood beside John Africa and told himself he ought to be grateful he still had a job after the dissolution of the Serious and Violent Crimes Unit. Grateful that he and his former commanding officer, Mat Joubert, hadn&#x2019;t been posted to a station like most of their colleagues. The new structures that were not new, it was like it was thirty years back, detectives at stations, because that was the way it was now done overseas, and the SAPS must copy them. At least he still had work and Joubert had put him up for promotion. If his luck held, if they could look past his history of drinking, and affirmative action and all the politics and shit, he would hear today whether he had made Captain.<br>&nbsp;<br>Captain Benny Griessel. It sounded right to him. He needed the raise too.<br>&nbsp;<br>Badly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Morning, Vusi,&#x2019; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Hey, Benny,&#x2019; Jimmy, the tall, skinny white coat from Forensics, greeted him. &#x2018;I hear they call you &#x201c;The Oracle&#x201d; now.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Like that aunty in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>,&#x2019; said Arnold, the short, fat one. Collectively they were known in Cape police circles as Thick and Thin, usually in the tired crack &#x2018;Forensics will stand by you through Thick and Thin.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;<i>The Matrix</i>, you ape,&#x2019; said Jimmy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Whatever,&#x2019; said Arnold.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Morning,&#x2019; said Griessel. He turned to the uniforms under the tree and took a deep breath, ready to tell them, &#x2018;This is a crime scene, get your butts to the other side of the wall,&#x2019; and then he remembered that this was Vusi&#x2019;s case, he should shut up and mentor. He gave the uniforms a dirty look, with zero effect, and hunkered down to look at the body.<br>&nbsp;<br>The girl lay on her belly with her head turned away from the street. Her blonde hair was very short. Across her back were two short horizontal cuts, matching left and right on her shoulder blades. But these were not the cause of death. That was the huge gash across her throat, deep enough to expose the oesophagus. Her face, chest and shoulders lay in the wide pool of blood. The smell of death was already there, as bitter as copper.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;<i>Jissis</i>,&#x2019; said Griessel, all his fear and revulsion welling up in him and he had to breathe, slow and easy, as Doc Barkhuizen had taught him. He had to distance himself, <i>he must not internalise this</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>He shut his eyes for a second. Then he looked up at the trees. He was searching for objectivity, but this was a dreadful way to die. And his mind wanted to spool through the event as it had happened, the knife fl ashing and slicing, sliding deep through her tissues.<br>&nbsp;<br>He got up quickly, pretending to look around. Thick and Thin were bickering over something, as usual. He tried to listen.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lord, she looked so young. Eighteen, nineteen?<br>&nbsp;<br>What kind of madness did it take to cut the throat of a child like this? What kind of perversion?<br>&nbsp;<br>He forced the images out of his mind, thought of the facts, the implications. She was white. That spelled trouble. That meant media attention and the whole cycle of crime-getting-out-of-control criticism starting all over again. It meant huge pressure and long hours, too many people with a finger in the pie and everyone trying to cover their ass and he didn&#x2019;t have the heart for all that any more.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Trouble,&#x2019; he said quietly to Vusi.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I know.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;It would be better if the uniforms stayed behind the wall.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ndabeni nodded and went over to the uniformed policemen. He asked them to go out another way, around the back of the church. They were reluctant, wanting to be part of the action. But they went.<br>&nbsp;<br>Vusi came to stand beside him, notebook and pen in hand. &#x2018;All the gates are locked. There&#x2019;s a gate for cars over there near the church office, and the main gate in front of the building here. She must have jumped over the railings &#x2013; it&#x2019;s the only way in here.&#x2019; Vusi spoke too fast. He pointed at a coloured man standing on the pavement on the other side of the wall. &#x2018;That <i>ou </i>there . . . James Dylan Fredericks, he found her. He&#x2019;s the day manager of Kauai Health Foods in Kloof Street. He says he comes in on the Golden Arrow bus from Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain and then he walks from the terminal.

But Xing left behind his organization, and Chen, while assigned to root the co-conspirators, is not sure whether he's actually being set up to fail. <br> In a twisting case that takes him from Shanghai all the way to the U.S., reuniting him with his colleague and counterpart from the U.S. Marshall's Service, Inspector Catherine Rhon, Chen finds himself at odds with hidden, powerful, and vicious enemies. At once a compelling crime novel and an insightful, moving portrayal of contemporary China, <i>A Case of Two Cities</i> is the finest novel yet in this critically-acclaimed, award-wining series.</p></p><p><p>QIU XIAOLONG was born in Shanghai and, since 1988, has lived in St. Louis, Missouri. A poet and translator, he is the author of the award winning novels featuring Inspector Chen, including <i>Death of a Red Heroine</i>, <i>A Case of Two Cities</i>, and the forthcoming <i>Red Mandarin Dress</i>.</p><p>Chapter 1<br>Chief inspector Chen Cao, of the Shanghai Police Bureau, was invited to a mega bathhouse, Birds Flying, Fishes Jumping, on a May afternoon.<br>According to Lei Zhenren, editor of Shanghai Morning, they would have all their worries luxuriously washed away there. &#x201c;How much concern do you have? / It is like spring flood / of a long river flowing east. This ultramodern bathhouse is really unique. Characteristics of the Chinese brand of socialism. You won&#x2019;t see anything else like it in the world.&#x201d;<br>Lei knew how to persuade, having quoted for the poetry-liking chief inspector three lines from Li Yu, the Southern Tang emperor poet. &#x201c;Characteristics of the Chinese brand of socialism&#x201d; was a political catchphrase, which carried a discordant connotation, especially in the context of the unprecedented materialistic transformation sweeping over the city of Shanghai. As it happened, Chen had just read about the bathhouse in an English publication:Every weekend night, about two thousand Chinese and several dozen foreigners gather together naked at Niaofei Yuyao&#x2014;a gigantic bathhouse, where the masses soak in tubs of milk, sweat in the &#x201c;fire jade heat room,&#x201d; watch movies, and swim in the pool. It&#x2019;s public and legal. After a round of miniature golf (clothing required), you can get a massage (clothing removed) and watch a Vegas-style show (the audience in pajamas, the performers in less than pajamas)... It took Chen two or three minutes to figure out the exact wording from the Chinese phonetics niaofei yuyao&#x2014;&#x201c;birds flying and fishes jumping.&#x201d; The name of the bathhouse actually came from an ancient proverb: The sea so wide for fishes to jump, the sky so high for birds to fly, which meant figuratively &#x201c;infinite possibilities.&#x201d; Perhaps too pompous a name for a bathhouse, yet a plausible allusion to its size and services. So he responded, &#x201c;Such a bath may be too luxurious, Lei. I now have a hot shower in my own apartment, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Come on, Comrade Chief Inspector Chen. If you flash your business card, the owner of the bathhouse will come rushing over, barefoot, to welcome you in. A high-flying Party cadre, and a well-published poet to boot, you deserve a good break. Health is the capital for making socialist revolution, as Chairman Mao said long ago.&#x201d;<br>Chen had known Lei for years, first through the Writers&#x2019; Association, to which both had belonged. Lei had majored in Chinese literature, and Chen in Western literature. But early on, they had both been state-assigned to their respective jobs, regardless of their own interests. Starting out as an entry-level business reporter, Lei had since enjoyed a steady rise. When Shanghai Morning was founded the previous year, he was appointed the editor-in-chief. Like other newspapers, Shanghai Morning was still under the ideological control of the government but responsible for its own financial welfare. So Lei made every effort to turn the newspaper into a more readable one, instead of one simply full of polished political clich�s. The efforts had paid off, and the newspaper rapidly grew popular, almost catching up with the Wenhui Daily in its circulation.<br>Lei talked about treating Chen&#x2014;in celebration of the newspaper&#x2019;s success. It was an invitation Chen found difficult to decline. For all these years, Lei had made a point of publishing Chen&#x2019;s poems in his newspapers.<br>But he could not be too cautious, Chen thought, in his position, in the days of guanxi&#x2014;connections spreading all over the city like a gigantic web. &#x201c;My treat, Lei,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Last time you bought me a great lunch at Xinya. It should be my turn now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tell you what, Chen. I&#x2019;m writing about the latest Shanghai entertainments. No fun for me to go there alone. So you&#x2019;re doing me a favor. Business expense, of course.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, no private room or private service, then.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to tell me that. It&#x2019;s not a good idea for people like you or me to be seen in those private rooms. Particularly in the heat of another anticorruption campaign.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s the headlines again,&#x201d; Chen said, &#x201c;in your newspaper.&#x201d;<br>Niaofei Yuyao turned out to be a six-story sprawling building on Jumen Road. The dazzling lobby, lit with crystal chandeliers, struck Chen more like a five-star American hotel. The entrance fee was two hundred yuan per person, with additional charges for services requested inside, a stolid manager explained, giving each of them a shining silver bracelet with a number attached to it.<br>&#x201c;Like dim sum,&#x201d; Lei said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll pay at the end of it, with all the services added to your number.&#x201d;<br>A reporterlike young man sidled over, carrying a camera with a long zoom sticking out like a gun. The manager rose to wave his hand in a flurry: &#x201c;Pictures are not allowed here.&#x201d;<br>Chen was surprised. &#x201c;If the picture is going to appear in a newspaper like yours,&#x201d; he said in a whisper, &#x201c;it may bring in more business.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, a large tree brings in a gusty wind against itself,&#x201d; Lei commented, changing into plastic slippers. &#x201c;This bathhouse doesn&#x2019;t need any more free advertisement, or the city government may feel obliged to check into its incredible business.&#x201d;<br>The pool area was the size of three or four soccer fields, not including the area for women. The water of three large pools shimmered green in the soft light. Majestic marble statues and fountains stood in each of them, imitations of ancient Roman palaces, except for an impressive array of modern water massage appliances along the poolsides. There were also special tubs with signs such as beer, ginseng, milk, and herbs. The brownish froth in the beer tub formed a sharp contrast to the white ripples over the milk tub. Chen looked into a gauze bag floating in the ginseng tub&#x2014;expensive if the thick roots it contained were genuine, though he was not so sure of their medical benefit in the hot bathwater.<br>&#x201c;These tubs are supposed to be effective,&#x201d; Lei said with a grin.<br>&#x201c;And very expensive too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The pools alone could have cost millions. A gamble on the boost the WTO accession will deliver to Shanghai&#x2014;an economic restructuring with waves of overseas capital inflows. China is currently the second-largest destination for foreign investment after the U.S. Soon it will be the largest.&#x201d;<br>Lei was taking an MBA class in the evening. For the new newspaper, he had to know things beyond his major in Chinese literature years earlier.<br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re writing an article about the bathhouse?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not just about this place, but the latest entertainment trends in general. Eat, drink, bathe, sleep, and whatnot. A middle class is rising up fast in China. They have money, and they need to know how to spend money. As an editor, I have to write what they want to read.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Indeed, pools of wine, woods of flesh,&#x201d; Chen said, echoing a classical description about the decaying Shang dynasty palace, as he stepped into a steaming hot pool.<br>&#x201c;Oh, much, much more,&#x201d; Lei chuckled in high spirits, &#x201c;like the Winter Palace in Russia, except it&#x2019;s so warm here, like the spring water. Or like in the late Roman empire.&#x201d;<br>Chen reclined against the poolside, the water massaging his back and purring as if with a collective contentment, including his. He tried to recall the name of the poet Lei had quoted, but without success.<br>&#x201c;What are you thinking, Chen?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2014;my mind is relaxing in a total blank, as you suggested.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Take it easy, Chen, with your new position in the city congress, and with your name as a best-selling poet.&#x201d;<br>To all appearances, Chen had been moving up steadily. His new membership in the Shanghai People&#x2019;s Congress was seen as another step toward his succeeding Party Secretary Li Guohua in the police bureau. But Chen was not so sure about it. The congress was known as a political rubber stamp, and thus city congressman was more of an honorary title. Possibly a compromise more than anything else, Chen knew, for quite a few hard-liners in the Party opposed his further promotion in the bureau, on the grounds of his being too liberal.<br>It was true, however, that his poetry collection had enjoyed unexpected success. Poetry makes no money and, in a money-oriented age, its publication was nothing short of a miracle. And it was actually selling well.<br>His thoughts were interrupted by two new bathers flopping down into the water, one short with gray hair and beady eyes, one tall with an aquiline nose and beer-bottle-thick glasses. Apparently, they were continuing an earlier argument.<br>&#x201c;Socialism is going to the dogs. These greedy, unscrupulous dogs of the Party officials! They&#x2019;re crunching everything to pieces, and devouring all the bones,&#x201d; the short one declared in indignation. &#x201c;Our state-run company is like a gigantic fat goose, and everyone must take a bite or pluck a feather or two from it. Did you know that the head of the City Export Office demands a five percent bonus in exchange for his export quota approval?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What can you do, man?&#x201d; the tall one said sarcastically. &#x201c;Communism echoes only in nostalgia songs. It&#x2019;s capitalism that&#x2019;s practiced here&#x2014;with the Communist Party sitting on the top, sucking a red lollipop. So what can you expect of these Party cadres?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Corrupt throughout. They don&#x2019;t believe in anything except doing everything in their own interest&#x2014;in the name of China&#x2019;s brand of socialism.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What is capitalism? Everybody grabs for his or her money&#x2014;in spite of all the communist propaganda in our newspapers. They&#x2019;re just like the beer froth in the tub.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The cops should have bang-banged a few ...</p></p><h2>The Fall of English France 1449&#x2013;53 (Campaign)</h2><p>For the overwhelming majority of people outside the French-speaking world the Hundred Years War consisted of a sequence of major English victories, above all Cr�cy, Poitiers and Agincourt. The only significant victor or &#39;hero&#39; on the French side was Joan of Arc, and she ended up being burned at the stake. Yet somehow the war ended in a French victory and with England&#39;s martial energies being turned against itself in the Wars of the Roses. This book is intended to provide some balance. It will describe the campaign that brought the Hundred Years War to a close, with English possessions being confined to Calais and the Channel Islands. It will also explain how the somewhat unprepossessing and unmartial King Charles VII of France succeeded where his predecessors had failed. The campaign consisted of more than battles, of course, but it was marked by two major victories - at Formigny in 1450 and at Castillon in 1453. Formigny is of special interest because it saw French cavalry defeat English archers, in effect a reversal of Cr�cy, Poitiers and Agincourt, and could be interpreted as one of the last &#39;medieval&#39; battles. Castillon is of interest because it was a victory of gunpowder artillery in fixed positions over a traditional medieval assault by mixed infantry and cavalry, and thus could be interpreted as one of the first &#39;modern&#39; battles.</p><p>Born in 1944, David Nicolle worked in the BBC&#39;s Arabic service for a number of years before gaining an MA from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, and a doctorate from Edinburgh University. He has written numerous books and articles on medieval and Islamic warfare, and has been a prolific author of Osprey titles for many years.&#x201c;...provides a fine narrowed focus on the battles of Formigny and Castillon which represented a change in how warfare was perceived and fought, and is a pick for any collection strong in medieval European history.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James A.

His is an aesthetic of ephemera but an ephemera that transcends itself, in which loss leads to wonder and then, inevitably, back to loss.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Los Angeles Times</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;As one of our greatest architecturally minded cartoonists, Katchor is a master at assessing not only the massive skyline but also the smallest detail, right down to the line on a mass-produced coffee cup logo. Little misses his critical civic gaze...[<i>Hand-Drying in America </i>is a] big and beautiful new graphic book...In Katchor&#x2019;s corporate chainscape, urban architecture becomes like piped-in and peddled smooth jazz &#x2014; designed to be agreeable, but repellent to the lover of rough edges and raw, original roots. Katchor has been building his brilliant refracted-satire worlds for decades, with <i>Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer</i> through to <i>The Cardboard Valise</i> (and earning praise from <i>Building Stories</i> graphic novelist Chris Ware and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon). The colorful universe of urban decay and dissipation in <i>Hand-Drying</i> feels entirely of a piece with those earlier works. It blends his scratched lines with deviously precise language that careers from mimicry and mockery to moments of reverent poetry. For all his cutting remarks, Katchor clearly loves the resilient soul of a city.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;Katchor&#x2019;s humor relies on cities for its strength: their grime, their dishonest denizens, and their beautiful decay seem to feed his imagination. This book hits its target in just about every panel...Sadness, whimsy, nostalgia, reflection, concern: These feelings all float through the frames which, despite the wizened appearance of their characters, could also be said to be bristling with energy, nearly in motion...The idea that the universal can be conveyed through close attention to particulars is a clich�, perhaps, but seeing it executed well is a rare pleasure. This book is that execution.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Boston Globe<br></i>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sumptuous...Katchor's visual depiction of humans rivals his prowess with buildings. He's never presented such a vast panoply of humanity before...Katchor's narratives&#x2014;which often end as bloodily as any Edward Gorey fable&#x2014;meander in a fashion that seems haphazard but really covers all his desired plot points in the most elegant and evocative way...the final panel features not a rich cluttered landscape but the lamenting man against a featureless white expanse. This is Katchor's concept of the ultimate dystopia, a sterile, featureless white room devoid of any human design. But so long as he continues to create his art&#x2014;&#x2018;These fragments I have shored against my ruins,&#x2019; as Eliot said&#x2014;then humanity is saved from such a fate.&#x201d; &#x2013;B&amp;N review&nbsp;<i>&nbsp; <br><br></i>&#x201c;Sublimely caustic...brilliant, darkly magical new collection.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review<br><br>&#x201c;Gorgeous...Katchor&#x2019;s judiciously sketchy drawings&#x2014;half art brut, half blueprint&#x2014;literate scripts, and comedic imagination make them the stuff of genius-level cartooning.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Booklist</i>, starred review <br><br>&#x201c;Half urban legend and half magic, these stories that seem on the one hand far-fetched but on the other are one small step away from being true...Katchor's stories don't feature characters so much as ideas. This way of writing could get boring awfully quickly&#x2014;except that the ideas he presents are so clever and haunted, it's hard to imagine that ever happening.&#x201d; &#x2013;Jewish Book Council <br><br>&#x201c;Ben Katchor, recipient of a MacArthur &#x2018;genius&#x2019; grant, lampoons our shallowest preoccupations so skillfully that half the laughs in his terrific collection,&nbsp;Hand-Drying in America and Other Stories, come from realizing you've done more or less the same absurd thing the cartoonist has taken to its logical extreme...It's the sum of four years' worth of piecework, but it's sharper still than the sum of its barbed parts.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Newsday&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;A dark, funny, and compelling experience, as engrossing to view as it is to read...Comparisons to Chris Ware, the other great comics artist who deals with urban structures and the enervating enclosure of modern living, seem obvious. Both specialize in architectural rendering and characters that are ill at ease within their cities. But against Ware&#x2019;s exploration of the sterile and alienating quality of modern technologies Katchor&#x2019;s work has a pungency and strange sexual energy applied to the appliances of the late 20th century. Then there is the quality of Katchor&#x2019;s humor, a smoked fish surrealism that gives a vaudevillian undercurrent to even his bleakest stories...Katchor trains his eye on everything we fail to notice, the details that are traditionally only props in the background, not fitting subjects for art. But Katchor&#x2019;s art is to take the human endeavor seriously by examining our interactions with something as mundane as a hand-drying machine. The pathos is in the appliances and the props become the subjects that reveal us to ourselves.&#x201d; &#x2013;The Daily Beast&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;<i>Hand Drying In America</i> is at once a mind-boggling work of alternate history and a powerful indictment of contemporary American society, but the stories seem only slightly surreal and entirely plausible. They're quick parables with the mind-altering power of smart philosophy wrapped up in goofy stories that glance down dead-end alleys with a combination of mordant humor and wistful nostalgia...Katchor's ability to creating elements of the fantastic that seem almost logical and yet are utterly mind-boggling is consistently amazing...The sketched, causal feel of the art combined with a very precise use of colors combine to establish an everyday urban gestalt. The places you visit feel real. It's as if Katchor has been to all the parts of whatever city you live in that your have not managed to visit yet...It is, not surprisingly, like an artifact from one of the worlds it creates, a troubling wedge that slides into the bricks of our beliefs and upsets a balance that we did not know to exist. Read it at your own risk; watch the walls of your world come tumbling down.&#x201d; &#x2013;Bookotron.com&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Katchor&#x2019;s vignettes brilliantly satirize human behavior, changing social values and cities in flux.

With hair teased to Jesus, mile-long false eyelashes, and a white Cadillac Eldorado with atomic-red leather seats, Fanny is not your typical granny rocking in a chair. Instead, think of a character that looks a lot like Eva Gabor in Green Acres, but darkened with a shadow of Flannery O&#x2019;Connor. A cross-genre collection that reads like a novel, this book is both a collection of oral history and a lyrical and moving biography that wrestles with the complexities of the South, including poverty, racism, and domestic violence. <br> <br> "Nickole Brown&#x2019;s unleashed love song to her grandmother is raucous and heart-rending, reflective and slap-yo-damn-knee hilarious, a heady meld of lyrical line and life lesson. Brown is blessed to be blood-linked to such a shrewd and singular soul, and the poet's mix of monologue, myth, and unbridled mayhem paints a picture of a proper Southern lady who is just&#x2014;well, unforgettable." &#x2014;<strong>Patricia Smith</strong> <br> <br> "In <em>Fanny Says</em>, Nickole Brown distills the whole of America into one woman: bawdy, loving, racist, battered, healed, and gorgeous with determination. Our country has no history that does not touch the South. Our divisions are our unions. Here, Brown unleashes a voice returned to teach us a lesson. Reader, fair warning: you can&#x2019;t hide from Fanny. You will be changed by this book." &#x2014;<strong>Rebecca Gayle Howell</strong></p></p><p><b>Nickole Brown</b> grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, and Deerfield Beach, Florida.

She is the Editor for the Marie Alexander Series in Prose Poetry at White Pine Press, and is also an Assistant Professor at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock, where she lives with her wife, poet Jessica Jacobs.<p>A NewPages "Editor's Pick" for 2015</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"Brown&#x2019;s sprawling sophomore collection is a lyrical biography of and tribute to her wise and irreverent southern grandmother. Along with a memorable lesson in the use of the word &#x2018;flitter,&#x2019; what&#x2019;ll stick most is this book&#x2019;s unknown &#x2018;word for all things left unbroken, a word for breakable yet unbroken things.&#x2019;"&#x2014;<strong>NPR Books</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"In a voice that is both authentic and colloquial, Brown tells the story, without sentimentality or clich�, of her grandmother Fanny. . . . It&#x2019;s rare to find a book of poems that reads like a well-plotted page-turner, each poem propelling the reader into the next, each poem filled with story and song. This is that book. VERDICT Bawdy and real, this volume will stay with readers long after Fanny has had her final say."&#x2014;<strong>Library Journal</strong>, Starred Review</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Brown&#x2019;s depiction of her cussing, pill-popping grandmother Fanny, who wears push-up brassieres along with starched, short-sleeved men&#x2019;s &#x2018;business&#x2019; shirts, is poignant, funny, and utterly real. Fanny&#x2019;s tone and inflection come alive through the series of poems based on her actual words. And through Brown&#x2019;s vivid, honest, and surprisingly nonjudgmental reflections, we develop, page by page, a mental image of her grandmother in the mid-twentieth-century South and can&#x2019;t help but enjoy the process of getting to know Frances Lee Cox. While this collection honors Fanny&#x2019;s span of years on this planet and her impact on her granddaughter, it also showcases the writer&#x2019;s humor, insight, and poetic gifts.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Booklist</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;This is a commentary on the South as a whole. . . . Fanny Says remains a tender character study above all else. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised to see a film adapted from this. It endures sentiment and challenges social notions. It is true to humanity and breathed with life.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>NewPages</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Nickole Brown has written an epic poem called Fanny Says. . . . It is in essence one long poem&#x2014;138 pages&#x2014;chambered like a heart and pumping language like blood to every stanza throughout this single, vital organ. Though Brown has written these words down, the oracular qualities of her grandmother, Frances Lee Cox&#x2014;her distinctive way of speaking, idioms and regionalisms, malapropisms and profanities all&#x2014;manifests so entirely that the reader is not really reading but listening as this monumental, multi-generational narrative unfolds.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>The Rumpus</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Many of us find it difficult to tell our family stories&#x2014;no surprise, as they are usually loaded. One of the accomplishments of Fanny Says is its skillful and unapologetic confrontation of the shamelessness of Brown&#x2019;s people&#x2014;and sometimes ours. . . . Here Brown is at her best&#x2014;writing calamity with eloquence, speaking, in the same moment, Fanny&#x2019;s complications and the poet&#x2019;s claim on it. This book, like a grandmother&#x2019;s love, is not always pretty, but it pulls you in and gives you so much truth.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Oxford American Magazine</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Brown blends descriptions of the immensely wise, brazen and sailor-mouthed Fanny with ruminations on both the power of memory and the Kentucky culture that surrounded them both. The editorial assistant for the late Hunter S.

In these poems, Brown finds the space and time to explore her own family and the South as an imagined location. In the tradition of great lesbian writers such as Dorothy Allison, Fannie Flagg, June Arnold and Rita Mae Brown, Nickole Brown spins a yarn that is at once fantastical and believable, one that leaves us, as readers, yearning for more.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Lambda Literary</strong></p> <p></p><br><br>&#x201c;Reading Nickole Brown&#x2019;s new book of poems, Fanny Says, is like being introduced to someone you never want to let go, the kind of fierce, tender, acerbic, complicated woman who will snag you by your scruff and tell you what you don&#x2019;t want to hear, and&#x2014;in the next breath&#x2014;what you need to hear.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Gwarlingo</strong><br><br><p>&#x201c;Nickole Brown first established herself as a major talent with her 2007 novel in poems, Sister, and Fanny Says marks a further development in Brown&#x2019;s exploration of what a poetry collection can be and do. . . . This book explores Fanny in all her troubled humanity, and confronts domestic violence, racism, and poverty in the American South.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Tahoma Literary Review</strong></p><br><br>"The imagery is blunt, the dialect true, and what unfolds is a metaphoric hope chest, a series of living flashbacks through which Brown creates a poetic treatise on memory&#x2019;s workings. . . . With subtle technique, Brown encourages the reader to take liberty with these crisp narratives and provokes us to imagine Fanny beyond the page." &#x2014;<strong>Oxford American</strong><br><br><p>&#x201c;Brown delivers poetic mastery with extraordinary craft and control of language, images, line and diction.&#x201d; &#x2014;<strong>Lambda Literary</strong></p><br><br>&#x201c;Like Allen Ginsberg&#x2019;s Kaddish or Sarah Blake&#x2019;s Mr. West, this book draws its energy from the personality of its main character/subject and the way the speaker engages with it.

Yet the income-level disparity in this country is now wider than at any point since the Great Depression. In 2010 the average salary for CEOs on the S&amp;P 500 was over $1 million climbing to over $11 million when all forms of compensation are accounted for while the current median household income for African Americans is just over $32,000. How can some be so rich, while others are so poor?<br> <br>In this provocative book, Peter Edelman, a former top aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a lifelong antipoverty advocate, offers an informed analysis of how this country can be so wealthy yet have a steadily growing number of unemployed and working poor. According to Edelman, we have taken important positive steps without which 25 to 30 million <i>more</i> people would be poor, but poverty fluctuates with the business cycle. The structure of today&#x2019;s economy has stultified wage growth for half of America&#x2019;s workers with even worse results at the bottom and for people of color while bestowing billions on those at the top.<br> <br> <i>So Rich, So Poor</i> delves into what is happening to the people behind the statistics and takes a particular look at the continuing crisis of young people of color, whose possibility of a productive life too often is lost on their way to adulthood. This is crucial reading for anyone who wants to understand the most critical American dilemma of the twenty-first century.<br></p><p><b>Peter Edelman</b> is a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.

Only three of the animals went unburdened, and these were hardly bears for riding. A stranger party could scarce be imagined. Here were bronze Indians straight out of Earth&#x2019;s Old West, squat, powerful Eskimos from the Motherworld&#x2019;s perpetually frozen north, great white bears half as big again as those of the Arctic Circle, and a tall, ruggedly handsome, leather-clad white man whose open, short-sleeved jacket showed a broad, deep chest and arms that forewarned of massive strength.<br>To the oddly polyglot party that followed Hank Silberhutte, their Warlord seemed utterly enigmatic. He was a strange, strange man: the toast of the entire plateau and master of all its might, mate to Armandra the Priestess and father of her man-child, destroyer of Ithaqua&#x2019;s armies and crippler&#x2014;however briefly&#x2014;of Ithaqua himself. And yet he mingled with his minions like a common man and led them out upon peaceful pursuits as surely as he led them in battle. Yes, a strange man indeed, and Ithaqua must surely rue the day he brought him to Borea.<br>Silberhutte the Texan had been Warlord for three years now, since the time he deposed Northan in a savage fight to win Armandra. He had won her, and with her the total command of the plateau&#x2019;s army. That had been before the War of the Winds, when the plateau&#x2019;s might had prevailed over the bludgeoning assault of Ithaqua&#x2019;s tribes, when Ithaqua himself had been sorely wounded by this man from the Motherworld.<br>Mighty wrestler, fighter who could knock even a strong man senseless with a blow of his huge fist, weapons&#x2019; master whose skill had quickly surpassed that of his instructors, telepath (though the plateau&#x2019;s simpler folk could not truly understand the concept) who could throw&#x2014;had thrown&#x2014;mental insults at Ithaqua, the Wind-Walker, and yet walk away unscathed: Silberhutte was all of these things. He was as gentle as his strength and size would allow; he instinctively understood the needs of his people; when lesser men approached him in awe, he greeted them as friends, equals; he respected the Elders and was guided by their counseling, and his fairness was already as much a legend as his great strength.<br>When he could by right have slain Northan, his hated, bullying Warlord predecessor&#x2014;when nine-tenths of the plateau&#x2019;s peoples had <em>wanted</em> Northan dead&#x2014;Hank Silberhutte had let him live, had given him his life. Later, when Northan turned traitor, siding with Ithaqua and his ice-priests to help them wage war against the plateau, Kota&#x2019;na the Keeper of the Bears had taken that life, had taken Northan&#x2019;s head too; and even though he was wounded in the fighting, Kota&#x2019;na would not give up his grisly trophy to any man but his Lord Silberhutte.<br>And it was Kota&#x2019;na who came now at an easy lope through the long grass toward where Silberhutte stood, Kota&#x2019;na whose proud Indian head was lifted high, eyes alert as those of any creature of the wild. He had scouted out the ground ahead, as two other braves even now scouted it to the rear; for though they were well clear of the territories of the Wind-Walker&#x2019;s tribes, still they were wary of skulking war parties. The Children of the Winds did not usually wander far afield when Ithaqua left them to go striding among the star-voids, but one could never be sure. That was why three of the bears were not in harness; they were fighters, white monsters whose loyalty to their master was matched only by their ferocity when confronted with their enemies. Now they were nervous, and Hank Silberhutte had noted their anxious snufflings and growlings.<br>He noted too Kota&#x2019;na&#x2019;s uneasiness as the handsome brave approached him. The Indian kept glancing toward the dark green shadows of the forest, his eyes narrowing as they sought to penetrate the darker patches of shade. Borea had no night as such, only a permanent half-light, whereby shaded places were invariably very gloomy.<br>What&#x2019;s bothering you, bear-brother? Hank asked, his keen eyes searching the other&#x2019;s face.<br>The same thing that bothers the bears, Lord Sil-ber-hut-te, the Indian answered. Perhaps it is just that Ithaqua&#x2019;s time draws nearer, when he returns to Borea... he shrugged. Or perhaps something else. There is a stillness in the air, a hush over the forest.<br>Huh! the Texan grunted, half in agreement. Well, here we camp, danger or none. The forest goes on for twenty miles or more yet, Kota&#x2019;na, so if we&#x2019;re being shadowed, we won&#x2019;t lose our tail until we&#x2019;re beyond the woods. We&#x2019;ll keep five men awake at all times; that should be sufficient. Six hours&#x2019; sleep, a meal, and then we press on as fast as we can go. Fifty miles beyond the forest belt we&#x2019;ll be back in the snows, and we&#x2019;ll find our sleighs where we left them. The going will be faster then. Fifty miles beyond that, across the hills, we&#x2019;ll sight the moons of Borea where they hang over the rim. Then&#x2014;<br>Then, Lord, we will be almost within sight of the plateau!<br>Where a pretty squaw called Oontawa waits for her brave, eh? the white giant laughed.<br>Aye, Lord, Kota&#x2019;na soberly answered, and where the Woman of the Winds will doubtless loose great lightnings to greet the father of her child. Ah, but I am ready for the soft comforts of my lodge. If we were fighting, that would be one thing&#x2014;but this dreary wandering... He paused and frowned, then: Lord, there is a question I would ask.<br>Ask away, bear-brother.<br>Why do we leave the plateau to wander in the woods? Surely it is not simply to seek out strange spices, skins, and tusks? There are skins enough in the white wastes and more than enough food in and about the plateau.<br>Just give me a moment, friend, and we&#x2019;ll talk, Silberhutte told him. He spoke briefly to the men about him, giving instructions, issuing orders. Then, while rough tents were quickly erected and a list for watch duties drawn up, he took Kota&#x2019;na to one side.<br>You&#x2019;re right, bear-brother, I don&#x2019;t come out under the skies of Borea just to hunt for pale wild honey and the ivory of mammoths. Listen and I&#x2019;ll tell you:<br>In the Motherworld I was a free man and went wherever I wanted to go, whenever I wanted to go there. There are great roads in the Motherworld and greater cities, man-made plateaus that make Borea&#x2019;s plateau look like a pebble. Now listen: you&#x2019;ve seen Armandra fly&#x2014;the way she walks on the wind&#x2014;a true child of her father? Well, in the Motherworld all men can fly. They soar through the skies inside huge mechanical birds, like the machine that lies broken on the white waste between the plateau and Ithaqua&#x2019;s totem temple. He snatched us out of the sky in that machine and brought us here...<br>He paused, beginning to doubt Kota&#x2019;na&#x2019;s perception. Do you understand what I&#x2019;m trying to say?<br>I think so, Lord, the Indian gravely answered. The Motherworld sounds a fine and wonderful place&#x2014;but Borea is not the Motherworld.<br>No, my friend, that&#x2019;s true&#x2014;but it could be like the Motherworld one day. I&#x2019;m willing to bet that hundreds of miles to the south there are warm seas and beautiful islands, maybe even a sun that we never see up here in the north. Yes, and I can&#x2019;t help wondering if Ithaqua is confined to this world&#x2019;s northernmost regions just as he is during his brief Earthly incursions. It&#x2019;s an interesting thought...<br>As to why I come out here, exploring the woods and the lands to the south: surely you must have seen me making lines on the fine skins I carry? They are maps, bear-brother, maps of all the places we visit. The lakes and forests and hills&#x2014;all of them that we&#x2019;ve seen are shown on my maps. One day I want to be able to go abroad in Borea just as I used to on Earth.<br>He slammed fist into palm, lending his words emphasis, then grinned and slapped the other&#x2019;s shoulder. But come now, we&#x2019;ve been on the move for well over ten hours. I, for one, am tired. Let&#x2019;s get some sleep, and then we&#x2019;ll be on our way again. He glanced at the gray sky to the north and his face quickly formed a frown. The last thing I want is to be caught out in the open when Ithaqua comes walking down the winds to Borea again. No, for he surely has a score to settle with the People of the Plateau&#x2014;especially with me!<br>* * *<br>In no great hurry to find Elysia (Titus Crow had warned him that the going would not be easy, that no royal road existed into the place of the Elder Gods), Henri de Marigny allowed the time-clock to wander at will through the mighty spaces between the stars. In the case of the time-clock, however, wander did not mean to progress slowly and aimlessly from place to place, far from it. For de Marigny&#x2019;s incredible machine was linked to all times and places, and its velocity&#x2014;if velocity could ever adequately describe the <em>motion</em> of the clock&#x2014;was such that it simply defied all of the recognized laws of Earthly science as it cruised down the light-years.<br>And already de Marigny had faced dangers which only the master of such a weird vessel might ever be expected to face: dangers such as the immemorially evil Hounds of Tindalos!<br>Twice he had piloted the time-clock through time itself; once as an experiment in the handling of the clock, the second time out of sheer curiosity. On the first occasion, as he left the solar system behind, he had paused to reverse the clock&#x2019;s temporal progression to a degree sufficient to freeze the planets in their eternal swing around the sun, until the worlds of Sol had stood still in the night of space and the sun&#x2019;s flaring, searing breath had appeared as a still photograph in his vessel&#x2019;s scanners. The second time had been different.<br>Finding a vast cinder in space orbiting a dying orange sun, de Marigny had felt the urge to trace its history, had journeyed into the burned-out planet&#x2019;s past to its beginnings.

Renowned as 'the world's most beautiful ballroom" and the largest, most elegant in Harlem, the Savoy was the only ballroom not segregated when it opened in 1926. The Savoy hosted the best bands and attracted the best dancers by offering the challenge of fierce competition. White people traveled uptown to learn exciting new dance styles. A dance contest winner by fourteen, Norma Miller became a member of Herbert White's world famous Whitey's Lindy Hoppers and a celebrated Savoy Ballroom Lindy Hop champion. </p><p><i>Swingin' at the Savoy </i>chronicles a significant period in American cultural history and race relations, as it glorifies the popularized home of the Lindy Hop, and the birthplace of such memorable dance fads as the Big Apple, Shag, Truckin', Peckin', Susie Q, Charleston, Peabody, Black Bottom, Cake Walk, Boogie Woogie, Shimmy, and tap dancing. </p><p>Miller shares fascinating anecdotes about her youthful encounters with many of the greatest jazz legends in music history including Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Billie Holiday, Artie Shaw, Duke Ellington, Ethel Waters, and even boxer Joe Louis.</p></p><h2>Learn Hangul in One Hour: A Complete Course on How to Teach Yourself the Korean Writing System</h2><p>Learn to read, write, and remember the Korean writing system, Hangul, in one hour. Also instantly learn the alphabet order. Trying to learn Korean using English letters is not just a waste of time, it can cause you a great deal of embarrassment! Learn to read, write and pronounce Korean the right way. Save yourself the time and possible embarrassment by getting it right. If you&#39;re interested in Taekwondo, Korean drama, or Korean pop singers, or a student of Korean language, this is the place to start. This book is a system that uses mnemonics to teach you the sounds so you can easily remember the Korean alphabet. You&#39;ll get sample vocabulary to both re-enforce and remember each character, and samples of each character as they appear both typed and handwritten. You&#39;ll also get complete, stroke-by-stroke, diagrams on how to write each letter.</p><p>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, wouldn't that journey be a lot easier if that first step was to reach for the phone and call a travel agent to book a reservation on the next flight to that destination?&nbsp;<br><br>Sure it would. This is the 21st Century and your time is valuable.&nbsp;<br><br>You don't have to take that journey on foot, and you don't have to travel alone.&nbsp;<br><br>This book is a lot like that. Buying this book is the first step of that journey to learn Hangul, and it can be easier and a lot more fun than you ever imagined. In fact, it may appear to even be too easy. That would be great, wouldn't it? Korean children spend weeks learning Hangul in elementary school, others who want to learn Korean language must first spend days and even weeks doing the same thing before they can even start. Don't waste your time and effort. There's no reason for you to learn Hangul that way.&nbsp;<br><br>With this book you can learn in about one hour what others have taken hours, days, even weeks to learn. Impress your friends and get a jump on your Korean language study with this method.This book is intended to teach you to learn and remember the Korean writing alphabet. This alphabet is called Hangul, and has been heralded by some to be one of the most scientific writing systems in use today. However, since it varies greatly from the English alphabet, it can appear daunting at first and traditional methods for learning and remembering it are boring and time consuming. If you follow the steps set forth in this book, you will accomplish this task, and you will do it in only 1 hour. 1 hour of concentrated study on the ideas set forth in this book. <br> &nbsp;<br> I am not a Korean language teacher in the formal sense, but I have spent a good deal of time studying the Korean language as well as a smattering of time on a couple of other languages. I wrote this book in response to the frustrations I've seen from those who were struggling to learn Korean but were doing it by following romanized versions of the words. I hate to see time and talent wasted, and to me, that is just what that kind of study is, a waste. If you're in Korea, you will see very little romanization (or other English spelling representations). Outside of road signs and a few restaurant menus, Hangul is the prevalent method for writing Korean, and it is well worth the time it takes to learn and remember it. Also, once you have mastered the alphabet, you will be surprised at how many things you are able to understand, especially since there are a great deal of foreign words in use in Korea but represented in Hangul and with a slightly different pronunciation. If you truly want to learn Korean, then learning Hangul is the first and most sensible step.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book will teach you to do this, learning on your own or in a group. Chinese characters are also used to represent the Korean language, but it is becoming less and less used though it still appears in newspaper headlines and many Koreans' name or business cards. This book won't be dealing with those characters. You will also need to continue your usage of your new found knowledge in order to permanently ingrain it into your memory and apply this knowledge to acquiring vocabulary. I am sure you will find this book helpful in starting you on the path to a wonderful experience with your study of Korean or stay in Korea.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Racing Rules of Sailing for 2021-2024</h2><p>The Racing Rules of Sailing for 2017 - 2020 including US Sailing Prescriptions.

If the day after you arrived in Ottawa you showed up to a 24-hour race and started knocking back beers, you would be stupid. If you then ran the 195 kilometre, 24-hour race, won it, and ran all the way back to Winnipeg, you&#x2019;d be a true freak of nature. If later, at 46 years old, you ran 7200 kilometres across Canada in the world-record time of 72 days, 10 hours, and then followed it up two weeks later by breaking another world record (which happened to be your own) in the longest certified race on Earth, you&#x2019;d be a mega-distance alien. In all of this, if you were forever broke, using fake names and aliases, teetering on the edge of sanity, and doing it all in three-ounce racing flats, you&#x2019;d be Al Howie.</p><p>Based on interviews with Howie himself during his final two years (he died in 2016), Jared Beasley&#x2019;s book takes the reader into the incomprehensible distances of a legendary runner and the amazing and complex world of an astounding figure in modern sports history.</p></p><p>Al Howie was born in West Kilbride, Scotland in 1945. He immigrated to Canada in the early 1970s and moved to Victoria, British Columbia, in 1978. He began running at the age of 29 in order to quit a three-pack-a-day cigarette habit and over the course of his remarkable career, won more than 50 marathons and ultramarathons. Howie fought poverty and a rare case of adult-onset diabetes to break numerous records in some of the longest races of the world. He still holds the world record for running across Canada faster than any runner to ever attempt it. Al Howie died in Duncan, British Columbia, Canada, on June 21, 2016.&#34;In the mid-1970s, there was almost a refugee crisis of hippies like Al looking for an out and for somewhere to fit in. A small group of these vagabonds found it in running. While it is hard to understand today, it was quite a spectacle back in the day to see someone &#34;jogging.&#34; It was not something people did, especially on the roads and sidewalks where so-called normal people went about their lives. These early warriors were scoffed at, misunderstood and derided as freaks. &#39;Running is for weirdos&#39; was a common quip of the day.&#34;</p><h2>The Imperial Archive: Knowledge and the Fantasy of Empire</h2><p>Nineteenth-century Britain could be seen as the first information society in history&#x2014;for the simple reason that it accumulated knowledge from the far-flung corners of its empire faster than it could easily digest it. The British Empire presented a vast administrative challenge; by meeting that challenge through maps and surveys, censuses and statistics, Victorian administrators developed a new symbiosis of knowledge and power. The narratives of the late nineteenth century are full of fantasies about an empire united not by force or civil control but by information.<br><br>In <i>The Imperial Archive, </i>Thomas Richards analyzes the ways in which the Victorian organization of knowledge was enlisted into the service of the British Empire, as fields like biology, geography and geology began to function almost as extensions of British intelligence. Richards argues that the techniques invented for managing this information explosion established an enduring axis between knowledge and the state and also suggested a powerful new direction for the novel. He illustrates his argument by careful reference to a variety of institutions&#x2014;above all the growth of the museum&#x2014;and texts, including works by Rudyard Kipling, Erskine Childers, H.G. Wells and Bram Stoker.</p><p><b>Thomas Richards</b> is Associate Professor of English and American literature at Harvard University.

Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover</h2><p>One of the most infamous and devastating assassinations in American history, the murder of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., was also one of the most quickly resolved by authorities: James Earl Ray was convicted of the crime less than a year after it occurred. Yet, did they catch the right person? Or was Ray framed by President Lyndon B Johnson and FBI Director J Edgar Hoover? <br><br> In <i>Who REALLY Killed Martin Luther King, Jr.?</i>, Phillip F. Nelson explores the tactics used by the FBI to portray Ray as a southern racist and stalker of King. He shows that early books on King&#x2019;s death were written for the very purpose of &#x201c;dis-informing&#x201d; the American public, at the behest of the FBI and CIA, and are filled with proven lies and distortions. <br><br> As Nelson methodically exposes the original constructed false narrative as the massive deceit that it was, he presents a revised and corrected account in its place, based upon proven facts that exonerate James Earl Ray. Nelson&#x2019;s account is supplemented by several authors, including Harold Weisberg, Mark Lane, Dick Gregory, John Avery Emison, Philip Melanson, and William F. Pepper. Nelson also posits numerous instances of how government investigators&#x2014;the FBI originally, then the Department of Justice in 1976, the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigators in 1978 and the DOJ again in 2000&#x2014;deliberately avoided pursuing any and all leads which pointed toward Ray&#x2019;s innocence.</p><p>This book, together with the three previous efforts, represents a major part of my life over the last decade and a half, from the point at which I decided to write what I felt was a more accurate, brutally honest, and politically incorrect account of Lyndon Johnson's ascension to the presidency -- and the reign of terror that followed.&nbsp; For many years, as I worked in the corporate world, I longed for someone more talented and articulate than me to write the "real" history of the turbulent 1960s and of President Johnson's historical imprint, "bark and all" as he used to (paradoxically) say. For a time--after Robert Caro's first two books were published--I thought that he would fill that void.&nbsp; Unfortunately, his last two books effectively changed my perspective on that point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My decision to begin my own research began at a very specific time:&nbsp; in late November, 2003, when I saw the broadcast of Episode No 9 of the History Channel's "The Men Who Killed Kennedy," titled "The Guilty Men."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before long, it became clear that many people were more than just a little upset about how that show shined a spotlight on the 36th POTUS as had never been done before.&nbsp; It was quickly shut down and the History Channel forced to agree never to broadcast it again -- not just Episode 9, but the other two new episodes (7 and 8) as well.&nbsp;That action came as the remaining sycophants from Johnson's reign (led by Bill Moyers, Jack Valenti, Lady Bird Johnson), joined by Jerry Ford and Jimmy Carter, took action akin to the book-burning rituals and Salem witch trials used as the ultimate remedies by authorities in bygone ages.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately, all three of the videos noted (and the previous six) are still available for purchase or free viewing on various internet sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the voice of Edgar F. Tatro that captured my attention the most in that video, and I have him to thank for being my inspiration in completing the previous books, and this one, which will be my final attempt to "rewrite history" in a way that I believe will eventually be proven to be one of the truest to the actual actions taken by people in real-time during the decade beginning at the point Lyndon B. Johnson forced his way onto the Democratic ticket as John F. Kennedy's running mate, July 15, 1960 and ending when he left after his one (and a quarter) term as president, on January 20, 1969.&nbsp;The following is excerpted from the last pages of the Epilogue of "Who <i>REALLY</i> Killed Martin Luther King Jr.? -- The Case Against Lyndon B. Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover":_______________&nbsp;Thanks in large part to the countless hours and the meticulous, indefatigable work of the many earlier researchers and authors cited throughout this book, we now know that James Earl Ray took the fall for a very sophisticated murder plot, of which he was completely unaware until after it was executed. We also know now that--in every so-called investigation by federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies--there was an explainable reason for why no real attempt was ever made to even acknowledge Ray's repeated pleas to find the man named "Raoul," who had guided him for nearly twenty thousand miles around the North American continent. There were many missed opportunities to follow that lead, even by the simplest measures, such as tracing the telephone numbers that Ray provided to his attorneys. The only serious work, of sorts, was the felonious attempt by the FBI--and later, to an even greater and more outrageous level, the absurdly counterproductive attempt by the HSCA--to deviously pin the Alton, Illinois, bank robbery on James, followed by a whole string of later&nbsp; bank heists allegedly done by his brothers--all equally baseless--to try to prove that "Raoul" was really a composite of his brothers Jerry and John.&nbsp;<br>Furthermore, we know that in addition to the participation of the Dixie Mafia in the plot, there were two sniper teams associated with the 902nd and the 111th MIGs; there were also numerous signs of the CIA's involvement, and the fact that the FBI was the guiding force throughout virtually all facets of the murder and subsequent cover-up. We know that all of it stemmed from a long-planned, highly coordinated, well-executed plot that brought all of these elements together under the auspices of well-placed politicians and employees of the federal, state, and local governments. We even know the names of the men, from the top of the hierarchy through the middle levels and down to the local, street-level operatives--most of whom have been named in the previous chapters--responsible for the murder of Dr. King.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing we don't know is how much longer this shamefully despicable lie--putting the blame on an innocent, vulnerable man who was set up months, even years, in advance--can remain in the nation's most secret closets. But it should now be understandable to all that the longer the nation's foundation continues to rest upon fabricated myths, built on top of fractured and crumbling truths--compounded with a patchwork of new, ever-greater lies to extend the original cover-up--the weaker and more vulnerable it will become. &nbsp;<b>Phillip F.

Nina believed her. Now she'll do anything for the boy she loves, to prove she's worthy of him. But when he breaks up with her, Nina is lost. What is she if not a girlfriend? What is she made of? Broken-hearted, Nina tries to figure out what the conditions of love are.<br> <br> "Finally, finally, a book that is fully girl, with all of the gore and grace of growing up female exposed." &#x2015;Carrie Mesrobian, author of the William C.

She lives in Huntington Beach, California, with her husband, two children, and a menagerie of animals.</p><p>"Finally, finally, a book that is fully girl, with all of the gore and grace of growing up female exposed. Arnold's gorgeous prose takes us to all sorts of places to show us what girls are made of: a high-kill animal shelter, an abortion clinic, a bridge to nowhere that adventure seekers bungee-jump from, and all the way to Italy, to the sites of classical and religious art, where our narrator Nina learns the sacred tradition of how stories are told via the contortion and pain of a woman's body. If you're looking to enter the mind of a girl navigating sex, love, and her own physicality, look no further than <em>What Girls Are Made Of</em>." &#x2015;Carrie Mesrobian, author of the William C. Morris finalist <em>Sex &amp; Violence </em></p> (<i>Other Print</i>)<br><br><p>"Arnold's latest reveals how capricious first love&#x2015;and our trust in it&#x2015;can be. Nina, 16, is trying to make sense of the obsession she feels for her first boyfriend. 'I know it isn't okay to care this much about a boy. I know it's not feminist, or whatever, to make all my decisions based on what Seth would think,' she chastises herself. Besides, she has grown up being told by her mother that all love has limits; it can't just surge forth unbridled. Then, just as Nina and Seth's relationship turns more intimate, he abandons her without explanation. In Nina's grief, she explores the origins of her longing for love, recalling a trip she took with her mother to Italy to study statues of saints, intertwining the saints' suffering with what she views as her own. Nina's honest musings about her vapid relationship with Seth, and also the relationship of her fickle parents, demonstrate a keen sense of introspection and self-respect. <strong>Smart, true, and devastating, this is brutally, necessarily forthcoming about the crags of teen courtship.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"We think we know what girls are made of. But not always. And Elana K. Arnold removes the veil&#x2015;which is as gory as often as it is gauzy. <em>What Girls Are Made Of </em>shows the true, beautiful, and confounding complexity of women. This one will rip your heart out."&#x2015; Martha Brockenbrough, author of <em>The Game Of Love and Death</em></p> (<i>Other Print</i>)<br><br><p>"Pulling back the curtain on the wizard of social expectations, Arnold (<em>Infandous</em>, 2015, etc.) explores the real, knotted, messy, thriving heartbeat of young womanhood. When Nina Faye's mother tells her that there is no such thing as unconditional love, that even a mother's love for a daughter could end at any time, Nina believes her&#x2015;after all, she has already seen many conditions of love at play: beauty, money, aloofness, sex. Two years later, the white, now-16-year-old not only confirms that these and more are unspoken stipulations of her relationship with her boyfriend, Seth (also white), but also finds they are part of the very fabric of cisgender girlhood that suddenly threatens to smother her. Nina's embroiling first-person prose alternating with what are revealed to be her own short stories lifts and examines the veils that encapsulate all the 'shoulds' and 'supposed tos' of teenage girlhood to expose bodily function, desire, casual cruelty, sex and masturbation, miscarriage and abortion, and, eventually, self-care. <strong>Arnold interweaves myriad landscapes</strong>, from the parched affluence of California neighborhoods to the ordered sadness of a high-kill animal shelter where Nina volunteers, from the sculpted terrain of Rome's brutalized virgin martyrs to the imperfect physicality of Nina's own body, <strong>into a narrative wholeness that is greater than its parts.

Now, Nina will do whatever is necessary to maintain his affection. She is fully aware that all love comes with conditions; her mother, in particular, has made that very clear. But as the only child of dysfunctional parents, Nina craves the attention that Seth offers. Thoughts of him occupy her every waking hour, so when she unwittingly fails his unexpected test of her loyalty, she finds herself alone and adrift, especially after she makes a startling realization. When even her best friend fails to support her, Nina looks for help and solace in unlikely places, including at a dog shelter. In an afterword, Arnold explains that this story is the result of her anger at and complicity in the rules that society applies to girls. Her overarching theme is the fallacy of believing in unconditional love. <strong>The author presents a hopeful conclusion as Nina learns that self-love and fulfillment can be found through helping others. </strong>VERDICT: <strong>Because of its complex symbolism and graphic imagery, this well-written novel is best suited to mature YA readers.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Stunning in its honesty and depth, <em>What Girls Are Made Of</em> unapologetically examines the strength, determination, and vulnerability of girls.

'No one loves without conditions.' Several years later, Nina understand the conditions by which her boyfriend Seth loves her: have plenty of sex, give him space, and, she learns one day, to promise to be willing to die with him. When she can't fulfill that last one, he breaks up with her, and now she is left pregnant and alone, contemplating the stories of the virginal saints she learned about while on a trip to Italy with her mother years ago and preparing for her abortion. Nina is powerful, messy, and broken, and her voice oscillates between an aloof coolness and anxious neediness; her sex with Seth (and there's a lot) is often as clinically described as her account of her gynecological exam. Nina's episodic narration moves between her relationship with Seth and memories of her visit to Italy and the tales of female saints, who, she discovers, are as much revered for their intact maidenhood as they are for their acts of sacrifice. The separate facets of the same Nina&#x2015;sexual, emotional, thoughtful, lonely&#x2015;finally begin to integrate into a whole in the hesitantly hopeful ending. <strong>Pair this with McGinnis' <em>The Female of the Species</em> </strong>(BCCB 7/16) <strong>for a nuanced look at the complications of girlhood.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Beautifully written and evocative, <em>What Girls Are Made Of </em>fearlessly examines the courage and struggle of being a teenage girl in the modern world.

Arnold explores themes of conditional and unconditional love through sixteen-year-old Nina's self-revealing narrative about her love for Seth. There is raw intimacy in Nina's unvarnished descriptions of her sexual experiences with Seth; her first pelvic examination; her discovery of sexual pleasure; her experience of an early 'medical' abortion; the pain she feels when Seth rejects her for the beautiful Apollonia; and the loss of the friendship of her best friend. She realizes that her unconditional desire for Seth causes her to be a young woman who is dependent upon Seth's needs and moods. In the high-kill dog shelter where she volunteers, she sees the unconditional love dogs have for their owners, despite being abandoned to die.<br></p><br><p><br><br>Her relationship with her mother (who has a history of miscarriages) is explored in memories of their trip to Italy where Nina reflected on martyred female saints and saw the wax sculptures of 'flayed' women's bodies. Entwined with Nina's narrative are her short stories linking sex and death in which she writes, for example, about the death cycle of a laying hen and about those female saints whose unconditional vows of chastity resulted in death. Arnold uses powerful scenes and vivid imagery to emphasize the vulnerability of the female body but Nina emerges from traumatic experiences as a strong female, secure in her identity.

This book by one of the nation's most insightful, articulate, and powerful Democrats at last breaks the silence that has greeted the Republican Party's revolution of 1994. When voters handed Democrats their worst defeat in 100 years, New Yorkers returned Daniel Patrick Moynihan to the Senate for his fourth term. Amid the wreck of his party's control and the disarray of programs and policies he has championed for three decades, Senator Moynihan here takes stock of the politics, economics, and social problems that have brought us to this pass. With a clarity and civility far too rare in the political arena, he offers a wide-ranging meditation on the nation's social strategies for the last 60 years, as well as a vision for the years to come.</p><p>Because Senator Moynihan has long been a defender of the policies whose fortunes he follows here, <i>Miles to Go</i> is in a sense autobiographical, an exemplary account of the social life of the body politic. As it guides us through government's attempts to grapple with thorny problems like family disintegration, welfare, health care, deviance, and addiction, Moynihan writes of "The Coming of Age of American Social Policy." Through most of our history American social policy has dealt with issues that first arose in Europe, and essentially followed European models. Now, in a post-industrial society we face issues that first appear in the United States for which we will have to devise our own responses. Ringing with the wisdom of experience, decency, and common sense, <i>Miles to Go</i> asks "why liberalism cannot be taught what conservatives seem to know instinctively"--to heed the political and moral sentiments of the people and reshape itself for the coming age.</p></p><p>When his 1965 report to President Johnson, &#34;The Negro Family: The Case For National Action,&#34; identified the breakdown of the traditional family as a major cause of African-American poverty and crime, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was roundly attacked by liberals for &#34;blaming the victims.&#34; Since then the debate has shifted in his direction and he has been in the forefront of many debates on welfare. His latest book on the subject mixes historical perspective, personal reminiscence, and his comments on the state of welfare today. His focus remains the family, and particularly the problem of illegitimacy and single welfare mothers, whom he believes trapped in dependency by the current system. Moynihan is hard on successive administrations for failing to heed his warnings. Contrarily he berates the Clinton administration too for its attempt at reform in 1996, predicting dire consequences.Daniel Patrick Moynihan was the author of numerous books, including On the Law of Nations, and coeditor (with Nathan Glazer) of Ethnicity, both from Harvard.</p><h2>Trees, Truffles, and Beasts: How Forests Function</h2><p>In today's world of specialization, people are attempting to protect the Earth's fragile state by swapping limousines for hybrids and pesticide-laced foods for organic produce. At other times, environmental awareness is translated into public relations gimmicks or trendy commodities. Moreover, simplistic policies, like single-species protection or planting ten trees for every tree cut down, are touted as bureaucratic or industrial panaceas.<br><br> Because today's decisions are tomorrow's consequences, every small effort makes a difference, but a broader understanding of our environmental problems is necessary to the development of sustainable ecosystem policies. In <i>Trees, Truffles, and Beasts</i>, Chris Maser, Andrew W. Claridge, and James M. Trappe make a compelling case that we must first understand the complexity and interdependency of species and habitats from the microscopic level to the gigantic.

The answer is in Helena Sheehan&#x2019;s fascinating account of her journey from her 1940s and 1950s beginnings, into the turbulent 1960s, when the Vietnam War, black power, and women&#x2019;s liberation rocked her bedrock assumptions and prompted a volley of life-upending questions &#x2013; questions shared by millions of young people of her generation. But, for Helena Sheehan, the increasingly radicalized answers deepened through the following decades.<br><br>Beginning by overturning such certainties as America-is-the-world&#x2019;s-greatest-country and the-Church-is-infallible, Sheehan went on to embrace existentialism, philosophical pragmatism, the new left, and eventually Marxism. Migrating from the United States to Ireland, she became involved with Irish republicanism and international communism in the 1970s and 1980s. Sheehan&#x2019;s narrative vividly captures the global sweep and contradictions of second-wave feminism, antiwar activism, national liberation movements, and international communism in Eastern and Western Europe &#x2013; as well as the quieter intellectual ferment of individuals living through these times. <em>Navigating the Zeitgeis</em>t is an eloquently articulated voyage from faith to enlightenment to historical materialism that informs as well as entertains.

Selected major articles on legend tripping, with introductory sections written by the editors, are followed by discussion questions and projects designed to inspire readers to engage critically with legend traditions and customs of legend tripping and to explore possible meanings and symbolics at work. Suggested projects incorporate digital technology as it appears both in legends and in modes of legend tripping.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Legend Tripping</i> is appropriate for students, general readers, and folklorists alike. It is the first volume in the International Society for Contemporary Legend Research series, a set of casebooks providing thorough and up-to-date studies that showcase a variety of scholarly approaches to contemporary legends, along with variants of legend texts, discussion questions, and projects for students.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Contributors</i>: S.

The massacre in Tantoura drove her from her home and from everything she had ever known. She had not left her village before, but she would never return. Now an old woman, Ruqayya looks back on a long life in exile, one that has taken her to Syria, Lebanon, the Gulf, and given her children and grandchildren. Through her depth of experience and her indomitable spirit, we live her love of her land, her family, and her people, and we feel the repeated pain of loss and of diaspora.</p><p>Radwa Ashour (1946&#x2013;2014) is a highly acclaimed Egyptian writer and scholar.

But with each battle and every passing reincarnation, is there not the danger of cracks developing in the glue that holds these warriors together? When a tense, unexpected battle with an Opast general is cut short, one pair is forced to reconsider their disparate oaths of vengeance and what seeking revenge truly means. And before another battle can get underway, the final Zweilt pair joins the fray at Twilight Hall.

The idea that your canine companion is a fully emotional being and acutely sensitive to your changing feelings and moods is the foundation of April Frost's original and highly effective training program.<br><br>One of the most difficult aspects of training a dog is clearly communicating your intentions. <b>Beyond Obedience</b> is the first book to work on the way you communicate with your dog, providing you with the necessary tools to truly understand how your dog's mind works and, therefore, how you can create an effective and mutually satisfying relationship.<br><br>Drawing on her extensive experiences as an animal behaviorist, Frost teaches you that training your dog should not be a tedious chore limited to exerting physical and psychological control over an animal's drives, but instead an enriching and spiritually fulfilling experience--gratifying for both human and animal. Frost discusses such essential concepts as mutual respect, unconditional love, mental and emotional discipline, and your expectations and priorities. She shows you how the insights gained from working with your dog can have positive, far-ranging effects on many areas of your life. <b>Beyond Obedience</b> offers valuable insight into the emotional bonds that enrich the lives of animals and their companions.</p><p>April Frost philosophizes that the key to successful dog training lies in establishing a spiritual and psychological connection between dog and human. Like the Monks of New Skete, the widely respected authors of <i>The Art of Raising a Puppy</i> and <i>How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend</i>, Frost endorses "love and respect" for a dog and treating each one as a unique individual. <i>Beyond Obedience</i> is not structured with day-to-day accomplishment deadlines or strict training goals in mind. Instead, the emphasis is on the individual dog, who will grow and develop at his own rate. Every chapter aims to enhance the human-canine bond. Topics include the mind and energy connection, how dogs can teach us as human beings, and new ways to improve communication. The book also offers alternatives to traditional veterinary care as more and more pet owners look for less chemically harsh ways to treat animals. Herbal remedies for carsickness, soiling problems, and stress are a taste of these natural substitutes. <i>Beyond Obedience</i> is much more than a dog-training guide--it is a new way of viewing our relationships with our dogs. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i>"Through a holistic, respectful, and nonviolent approach, Frost teaches how to intensify relationships between humans and dogs -- with better results for each." <br>--USA Today</p><h2>The Siege of Budapest: One Hundred Days in World War II</h2><p><p><b>The definitive history of one of the fiercest battles of World War II</b><br><br> This definitive history of one of the fiercest battles of World War II describes the siege of Budapest in unprecedented detail.

Wise and impetuous, plainspoken and compassionate Szymek, recalls his youth in their village, his time as a guerrilla soldier, as a wedding official, barber, policeman, lover, drinker, and caretaker for his invalid brother. Filled with interwoven stories and voices, by turns hilarious and moving, Szymek&#x2019;s narrative exudes the profound wisdom of one who has suffered, yet who loves life to the very core.</p><p>Wieslaw Mysliwski is the only writer to have twice received the Nike Prize, Poland's most prestigious literary award: in 1997 for his novel <i>Horizon</i> and again in 2007 for <i>A Treatise on Shelling Beans</i>.

The moods range from the rollicking humor of Rudyard Kipling&#x2019;s &#x201c;On Dry-Cow Fishing as a Fine Art&#x201d; and the rural gothic of Annie Proulx&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Wer-Trout&#x201d; to the haunting elegy of Norman Maclean&#x2019;s &#x201c;A River Runs Through It.&#x201d;<br><br>Many of these tales celebrate human bonds forged over a rod, including Guy de Maupassant&#x2019;s &#x201c;Two Friends,&#x201d; Jimmy Carter&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fishing with My Daddy,&#x201d; and an excerpt from Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s <i>The Garden of Eden</i>. Some deal in reverence and romance, as in Roland Pertwee&#x2019;s &#x201c;The River God,&#x201d; and some in adventure and the stuff of legend, as in Zane Grey&#x2019;s &#x201c;The First Thousand-Pounder&#x201d; and Ron Rash&#x2019;s &#x201c;Their Ancient Glittering Eyes.&#x201d; There are narratives that confront head-on the heartbreaks and frustrations of the sport, from Thomas McGuane&#x2019;s meditation on&nbsp; long spells of inaction as the essence of fishing in &#x201c;The Longest Silence&#x201d; to Raymond Carver&#x2019;s story of a boy&#x2019;s deflated triumph in the gut-wrenching masterpiece &#x201c;Nobody Said Anything.&#x201d; And alongside the works of literary giants are the memories of people both great and humble who have found meaning and fulfillment in fishing, from a former American president to a Scottish gamekeeper&#x2019;s daughter.<br><br>Whether set against the open ocean or tiny mountain streams, in ancient China, tropical Tahiti, Paris under siege, or the vast Canadian wilderness, these stories cast wide and strike deep into the universal joys, absurdities, insights, and tragedies of life.<br><br>This beautiful hardcover edition features seven original woodcut illustrations by Paul Gentry,&nbsp;and includes a silk ribbon marker, European-style half-round spine, and&nbsp;full-cloth case with two-color foil stamping.</p></p><p>Poet, essayist and winner of the Oregon Book Award, Henry Hughes is a professor of English at Western Oregon University.&nbsp;He is also the editor of <i>The Art of Angling: Poems about Fishing.<br></i><i>Excerpted from the introduction</i><br>&#x2018;Sounds like a fish story,&#x2019; my father said, crossing his arms, and squinting down at me from the dock. Just fourteen, I had waited over an hour that morning for my friend Tony before motoring out alone in my little boat, crossing the rough breakwater into the choppy sound, casting a polished Hopkins for cocktail blues &#x2013; when something else struck. My cheap yellow rod bent double and pulsed wildly as line sang off the spool. Yes, yes, I thanked the heavens, adjusting my drag, and reeling when the fish turned. For fifteen minutes I stayed with its long runs and broad dodges, keeping the line clear of the prop when it got close and shot under the hull. Finally, in the sweating thrill of an instant, my flimsy blue net at the ready, there was a huge swirl and tail splash, then a glowing bronze flank just below the surface. Oh, my God, I said aloud. Striped bass! Stripers were scarce in those days on the north shore of Long Island, caught only by pros with live eels under the moon. But I was into a huge one &#x2013; maybe thirty, forty pounds, maybe more. I&#x2019;ll never know. Suddenly it was gone, the snapped line sagging between the guides of my rod. Another boat had pulled close to watch the battle, and the man behind the wheel just shook his head and sped away. The late morning sun suddenly felt hot, a ferry horn groaned in the distance, herring gulls hovered above. I would later learn that Tony&#x2019;s grandmother had died in the night. She was a great old Italian lady who loved to hear about our adventures. &#x2018;You boys bring home some nice fish, okay?&#x2019; she would always tell us. All I&#x2019;d bring home that day was a story.<br> &nbsp;<br> But this story and many others &#x2013; experienced, heard, and read over the years &#x2013; have taught me that fishing is about more than lifting a dripping trophy for a photo. One comes to know the fish and its world, the best techniques, and the right bait, lure, or fly. One learns to appreciate the beautiful, changing elements of sky, land, and water; the periods of feverish action, talk, and laughter; and the long, quiet hours of hope and contemplation. For millennia people&#x2019;s lives and cultures have been woven into this ancient art. Whether it&#x2019;s a Chinese sage angling without a hook to cultivate virtue for himself and the state or a humble Scottish gamekeeper&#x2019;s daughter setting a record that has stood for almost a century, fishing stories dramatize those things we pursue, hold on to, lose, and let go of in life.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s not surprising, therefore, that fishing has generated more great literature and attracted more writers than any other sport, and this collection attempts to pull in some of the best of them. Anton Chekhov, Guy de Maupassant, Ernest Hemingway, and Raymond Carver are literary lions who loved to fish, finding in it some of the happiest and most painful moments imaginable. In Maupassant&#x2019; s heartbreaking story &#x2018;Two Friends,&#x2019; set during the Franco-Prussian War, two reunited companions in besieged Paris risk their lives crossing enemy lines to enjoy a little angling along the Seine. Raymond Carver&#x2019;s equally wrenching tale, &#x2018;Nobody Said Anything,&#x2019; features an adolescent boy who hopes a fish will carry him past bitter domestic battle lines. Hemingway, who writes famously of fishing in &#x2018;Big Two-Hearted River,&#x2019; The Sun Also Rises, and The Old Man and the Sea, here provides a delightful scene from The Garden of Eden where the husband of a young honeymooning couple hooks a large sea bass in the Mediterranean inlet beside their French hotel. &#x2018;Oh what a wonderful fish! Wait for me!&#x2019; the wife shouts down from the hotel window. When the man finally lands the bass in front of an admiring crowd and his adoring wife, he fulfills a male fantasy of <i>p&#x2c6;echer devant une femme</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lest male machismo grow overlarge in these well-seasoned tales, Elizabeth Enright&#x2019;s &#x2018;A Little Short of the Record&#x2019; properly deflates the hubris and dishonesty of an insecure husband and fisherman, exposing the truth about his skillful and resilient wife and her trophy bonefish. Jerome K. Jerome speculates on the tendency of fishermen to exaggerate and even fabricate their catches as comically revealed in the destruction of a mounted trout in a Thames tavern, while Rudyard Kipling tramples his own angling prowess with a hilarious account of fly casting beside a meadow and accidently hooking a seven-hundred-pound cow. Annie Proulx&#x2019;s gothic tale, &#x2018;The Wer-Trout,&#x2019; shows us that wife-abandoned men, alone in upper Maine&#x2019;s myth-shrouded bogs, swirling with booze and bravado, can even begin to look and behave like fish.<br> &nbsp;<br> Svend Fleuron, Norman Maclean, and Ueda Akinari imagine piscine lives, giving us a view from the other end of the line. Akinari&#x2019;s Buddhist classic from eighteenth-century Japan tells us what it&#x2019;s like for a human to become a fish and get caught, linking mastery in art with the powers and dangers of transformation. Equally fantastic yet emblematic of the fisherman&#x2019;s conscience and symbolic of our relationship with nature is a caught fish that asks to be released. In &#x2018;The Salmon Spirit,&#x2019; a story from the Ulchi people of Siberia, a small spared fish miraculously provides a hungry family with a brimming pot of salmon. As in Grimm&#x2019;s fairy tales and similar folklore from around the world, kindness and mercy for nature&#x2019;s creatures is rewarded with plenty, suggesting some early notions of catch-and-release conservation and its dividends.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although the art of fiction can net the greatest truths, non-fiction narratives of epic battles with big fish make a splash here as well, notably Georgina Ballantine&#x2019;s testimony of a two-hour struggle with a fresh-run salmon on Scotland&#x2019;s River Tay, resulting in a British record &#x2013; sixty-four pounds &#x2013; that still stands today. Other thrills of the early twentieth century include Charles Holder&#x2019;s amazing tuna plunge off the California coast, Zane Grey&#x2019;s enthralling fight with a thousand-pound Tahitian marlin, and F. A. Mitchell Hedges&#x2019; Caribbean adventure in which he and his beloved guide battle and shoot a giant stingray off the Jamaican coast.<br> &nbsp;<br> Emphasizing the more sporting ethics of bullet-free angling are some gentler outdoorsmen, including Roderick Haig-Brown, Nick Lyons, Ted Leeson, and Charles Rangeley-Wilson. A Canadian master of the understated fishing narrative and a keen observer of nature, Haig-Brown sketches a day of high-river salmon fishing shared with a bear. Nick Lyons gives us a quintessential story of a father and son, &#x2018;On the Divide,&#x2019; as patience, understanding, personal obsessions, and parenthood are tested by the son&#x2019;s eleventh-hour brook trout that gets tangled in the anchor line. Ted Leeson takes his obsession alone into the mists of an autumn morning, fly casting for sea-run cutthroat on an Oregon river. &#x2018;To fish well,&#x2019; Leeson writes, &#x2018;is to cultivate an arrangement of time and place, of circumstance and perspective,&#x2019; a philosophy that flows through many of these stories. Charles Rangeley-Wilson reminds us that these arrangements may cast us back in time and into surprising places as he fulfills a childhood dream by angling for sharks &#x2013; locally called &#x2018;tope&#x2019; &#x2013; outside his humble seaside hometown on the north coast of England.<br> &nbsp;<br> Free of the gleaming pretenses of high-end charters, &#x2018;Wash and Tope&#x2019; humorously features an unassuming captain steering from his &#x2018;potting-shed cabin&#x2019; while four disorganized friends drink tea, get seasick, improvise gear, and hook a few fish.<br> &nbsp;<br> A day&#x2019;s fishing with friends or family creates a wave of connections, like those in President Jimmy Carter&#x2019;s vignette of bluegill fishing with his forgiving father in rural Georgia; Lin Sutherland&#x2019;s zany road trips with her mother; Marjorie Sandor&#x2019;s lifelong tangle with fishing, family, and Judaism; and Roland Pertwee&#x2019;s &#x2018;The River God,&#x2019; in which an elderly fisherman met on holiday in Wales inspires a young boy&#x2019;s enduring awe. And no collection would be complete without an excerpt from Norman Maclean&#x2019;s classic A River Runs Through It, the story of his beloved brother, Paul, a complicated young man who plays cards, tips whisky, fights, and fly fishes like a wizard with a wand.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fishing can change, move, and even save people. &#x2018;It is faith, not knowledge, that leads to paradise,&#x2019; David James Duncan tells us in &#x2018;First Native,&#x2019; recalling the childhood trauma of crucifying a live stonefly for bait, only to experience the life-changing revelation of catching a wild trout: &#x2018;the rainbow, the whole shining body flying up out of the water, filling me for the first time, then again and again, with so much yearning and shock and recognition and joy that I can no longer swear I remained in my body.&#x2019; Fishing bestows blessings but requires offerings, whether it&#x2019;s the cost of bait, fuel, and equipment, or the investment of brainpower, sweat, and the precious gifts of hope and time. This exchange is beautifully realized in &#x2018;The Longest Silence&#x2019; by Thomas McGuane, America&#x2019;s greatest angling essayist. Both funny and very serious, driftingly contemplative and driven like a skiff at full throttle across the Florida keys, McGuane takes us on a fly fishing quest that ends simply in &#x2018;ecstatic resignation to the moment.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> To remember that moment &#x2013; to cherish something held or lost, as I do my striped bass and the many fish, waters, and people I&#x2019;ve been touched by over the years &#x2013; is to carry the spirit of angling close, like a well-worn book in your pocket. I have tried in this book to net the best, but many fine tales were released and many more remain to be caught and enjoyed. Still, it is my hope that this sampling entertains and inspires those who love both fishing and storytelling. In honor of the rich tradition of visual arts devoted to fishing, this collection also showcases wood engravings by my friend and fellow angler, Paul Gentry. Our combined efforts are meant to make Fishing Stories a tribute to the fruitful entwining of art, sport, and imagination, and to the promise of more good angling and more good stories ahead.</p><h2>Julian, Volume I. Orations 1-5 (Loeb Classical Library No. 13)</h2><p><p>Julian (Flavius Claudius Iulianus) "the Apostate", Roman Emperor, lived 331 or 332 to 363 CE. Born and educated in Constantinople as a Christian, after a precarious childhood he devoted himself to literature and philosophy and became a pagan, studying in various Greek cities. In 355 his cousin Emperor Constantius called him from Athens to the court at Milan, entitled him "Caesar", and made him governor of Gaul. Julian restored Gaul to prosperity and good government after the ravages of the Alamanni (he overthrew them at the battle of Strassburg in 357) and other Germans. Between 357 and 361 Julian's own soldiers, refusing to serve in the East at Constantius's orders, nearly involved Julian in war with Constantius&#x2014;who however died in 361 so that Julian became sole Emperor of the Roman world. He began many reforms and proclaimed universal toleration in religion but pressed for the restoration of the older pagan worships. In 362&#x2013;363 he prepared at Constantinople and then at Antioch for his expedition against Persia ruled by Shapur II. He died of a wound received in desperate battle.</p><p>Julian's surviving works (lost are his <i>Commentaries</i> on his western campaigns), all in Greek, are given in the Loeb Classical Library in three volumes. The eight <i>Orations</i> (1-5 in Volume I, 6-8 in Volume II) include two in praise of Constantius, one praising Constantius's wife Eusebia, and two theosophical hymns (in prose) or declamations, of interest for studies in neo-Platonism, Mithraism, and the cult of the Magna Mater in the Roman world. The satirical <i>Caesars</i> and <i>Misopogon</i>, Beard-hater, are also in Volume II. <i>The Letters</i> (more than eighty, Volume III) include edicts or rescripts, mostly about Christians, encyclical or pastoral letters to priests, and private letters. Lastly in Volume III are the fragments of the work <i>Against the Galilaeans</i> (the Christians), written mainly to show that evidence for the idea of Christianity is lacking in the Old Testament.</p></p><p><p>Wilmer Cave Wright (1868&#x2013;1951) was Professor of Greek at Bryn Mawr College.</p></p><h2>The Penguin Illustrated History of Britain and Ireland: From Earliest Times to the Present Day (Penguin Reference Books)</h2><p>Compiled by a team of leading historians, this is a wonderfully rich, lavishly illustrated history of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.

There are more than 500 million copies of her books in print.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br> The first kill was an accident. Mostly.<br> All they wanted was a nice car&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t even have to be fancy&#x2014;because their piece of shit truck shuddered, wheezed, then let out a death rattle just after they&#x2019;d crossed over into Arkansas from Oklahoma.<br> It was Ella-Loo&#x2019;s idea how to go about acquiring a new ride. She&#x2019;d always had ideas, and dreams along with them, and since meeting Darryl she&#x2019;d come to believe those dreams would come true.<br> She&#x2019;d been working in a cowboy bar in Dry Creek, a place many who lived there considered the armpit of Oklahoma as it sat on a curve of a desolate spit of land where the Panhandle cornered into Texas. None of her dreams had come true; and, in fact, the man she&#x2019;d been with&#x2014;that son of a whore Cody Bates&#x2014;had given her a black eye and split her lip open before he&#x2019;d left her flat on the ground in front of the very bar she now worked.<br> She knew she was made for better things than serving up beer and rotgut whiskey to cowboys and the hard-eyed women who dogged them. She was made for better than pulling in extra giving blow jobs or quick bangs in the bathroom stall or the cab of a pickup to men with beer breath and no ambitions beyond the next ride.<br> The better walked into Rope &#x2019;N Ride one fateful night in the person of Darryl Roy James. She knew, the minute she laid eyes on him.<br> He was the one. What had been missing. What she needed to complete all she was and could be.<br> Later she would tell him how when he came through the fake saloon doors, light&#x2014;red-gold as a sunset&#x2014;had glowed around him. His bright hair had shimmered with it, and his eyes&#x2014;blue and clear as lake water on a postcard&#x2014;had glowed.<br> And she knew all she needed to know.<br> He wasn&#x2019;t like the others, nothing like the barn-smelling, ass-grabbing sort that frequented the Rope &#x2019;N Ride.<br> He had something.<br> After a brief, intense mating dance, after he&#x2019;d all but nailed her to the stall door in the bathroom, then again against the wall outside the break door, he&#x2019;d told her the same.<br> One look, he&#x2019;d said. Like, no sooner looked than loved. That was from a book. From Shakespeare. Darryl had read some Shakespeare&#x2014;Slick Willy, he called him&#x2014;while getting his high school diploma courtesy of juvenile detention in Denton County, Texas, where he&#x2019;d run off to find his fortune at sixteen.<br> He&#x2019;d walked out of juvie at eighteen, into a job at his mother&#x2019;s boyfriend&#x2019;s garage. Darryl had a way with engines as some had a way with horses. Barlow, who nagged Darryl to distraction, said if he spent as much effort on the job as he did dreaming about being somewhere else, he&#x2019;d be a rich man.<br> But Darryl had never seen the point in working himself to death when there were so many other ways to get what he wanted. And taking it from somebody else was the best way he knew.<br> Still, since he didn&#x2019;t want to go back to jail, he stuck it out for the lifetime of nearly three years.<br> Then he&#x2019;d gotten what he wanted by stealing the $6,800 under-the-table cash Barlow kept hidden under the false bottom of a drawer in his office.<br> Which showed what a dumbass Barlow was.<br> Then he&#x2019;d helped himself to some equipment, some parts, busted open the display case on Barlow&#x2019;s prized bowie knife&#x2014;figuring he could sell it along the way.<br> He&#x2019;d packed up while his mother was at work waiting tables as she always had for piss-poor pay and worse tips. He pocketed $3,200 from the pouch she kept in her flour tin&#x2014;it rounded him up to $10,000.<br> As he considered himself a good son, he&#x2019;d left her the remaining $646 with a note that read:<br> Thanks, Ma. Love, Darryl<br> He&#x2019;d loaded up the truck he boosted from the garage, and said adi-fucking-os to Lonesome, Oklahoma.<br> He walked into the Rope &#x2019;N Ride, and Ella-Loo&#x2019;s life on his twenty-first birthday.<br> That was fate, they determined, as they were a gift to each other.<br> Within twenty-four hours she and the duffel bag holding all her worldly possessions were loaded in the truck with him.<br> They drove fast, spent lavishly, stole when the mood struck, and fucked like a pair of rabid minx at every opportunity.<br> By the time Darryl was arrested in Tulsa for trying to pocket an engagement ring for his soul mate, they&#x2019;d blown through nearly every dollar they had between them.<br> He got four years&#x2014;as he&#x2019;d had the bowie knife on him&#x2014;and this time in the Oklahoma State Pen.<br> Ella-Loo waited for him. She took a job at another bar, made extra with bjs&#x2014;though she wouldn&#x2019;t, even for good money&#x2014;allow any other penetration.<br> She was a one-man woman.<br> As devoted as a priest at Sunday Mass, she visited Darryl every week, and, in fact, conceived a child on a conjugal visit.<br> Darryl read more Shakespeare and honed his mechanical skills. He learned more about engines, learned how to build bombs, learned more complex ins and outs of computers and electronics.<br> He got himself an education he might&#x2019;ve put to good use on the outside.<br> She named the baby Darra, after her Darryl, and drove her back to Elk City where Ella-Loo presented the infant to Darra&#x2019;s grandma.<br> Though she could hardly stand to be away from Darryl so long, she gave it ten days. Long enough for her mother to fall in love with the baby, and for her stepfather to relax his guard.<br> Knowing her mother would never allow her stepfather to set the cops on her, she took her great-grandmother&#x2019;s silver&#x2014;it would&#x2019;ve come to her one day anyway&#x2014;left the baby, and drove back to McAlester for the next visiting day.<br> Maybe, when they were ready to settle down, she and Darryl would go back for their daughter. But like Darryl said, they were star-crossed lovers, and had to live and love every minute to the full.<br> A baby didn&#x2019;t fit in with that.<br> He got out in three and a half years, due to good behavior, and she was waiting for him wearing a tight white dress and red high heels.<br> They barely made it to the by-the-month room before the dress was on the floor and the shoes were in the air.<br> As they both agreed they wanted McAlester in the truck&#x2019;s rearview, they spent only that night eating, drinking&#x2014;the sparkling wine Ella-Loo had copped from the bar where she would no longer work or give bjs&#x2014;and having sex.<br> She wanted to go east, clear to the Atlantic Ocean. She wanted big city lights and noise and everything that wasn&#x2019;t Oklahoma.<br> New York City, she told Darryl, was their destiny, as it was the only town big and bright enough to hold them.<br> So when Darryl&#x2019;s truck coughed and wheezed, he used his skill&#x2014;and parts he stripped off another he found in a parking lot&#x2014;got it running pretty smooth again. He headed east with the radio blaring and Ella-Loo curled against his side like an appendage.<br> Even with his skill, the old truck couldn&#x2019;t handle the miles or the speed, and died like a dog.<br> And Ella-Loo had her idea.<br> Darryl managed to baby and jury-rig the truck enough to limp it off the main road while she consulted the in-dash computer. It seemed to her they might have some luck on a little stretch along Highway 12, some ways south of Bentonville.<br> She dug out that white dress and those red heels, reddened her lips and, bending from the waist, finger-combed her long blond hair.<br> She was hoping for a man&#x2014;a lone man&#x2014;as she had no doubt a man would stop for her. The dress sat snug on her curves, rode high on her thighs, and when she flipped her hair up again, it tumbled like a siren&#x2019;s.<br> She laughed, and shooed Darryl back when he tried to grab at her.<br> &#x201c;You just wait, baby, you just wait. And stay out of sight now. A man comes along, he&#x2019;s going to stop to help me out for sure.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s gonna want to do more than that. Holy Jesus, Ella-Loo, you&#x2019;re sexy as black lace panties. I got a boner so big it&#x2019;s killing me just looking at you.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the idea. If a woman comes along, she might stop, might not. A couple of men will, a couple of women might. Mix it up, it&#x2019;s back to maybe. But sooner or later, baby.&#x201d;<br> She ran her finger over his mouth, gave him a grind, crotch to crotch, that made him moan before she nudged him away.<br> &#x201c;More of that later, honey. It&#x2019;s not full dark yet. People are more inclined to stop to help before it gets dark. Go on back in that brush there. I&#x2019;ve got to look helpless, and I won&#x2019;t when I&#x2019;ve got myself a strong, handsome man beside me.&#x201d;<br> She&#x2019;d chosen the spot well&#x2014;maybe too well as the sun dipped lower without a single vehicle passing going either way.<br> &#x201c;I maybe could get it running again,&#x201d; Darryl called out. &#x201c;Enough to get to a motel or a town, just boost something there.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;This is going to work, Darryl.&#x201d; She had her mind set on it. &#x201c;We just have to&#x2014;I see a car coming. When he stops, give me some time to play it up. Then you come out, baby, and take care of it. You&#x2019;ll take care of it, won&#x2019;t you, Darryl?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You know I will.&#x201d;<br> She stood beside the car, hands clasped together as if in prayer, big blue eyes wide with what she hoped came off as a little hope, a little fear.<br> She loved playacting.<br> And she felt her excitement rise as the car&#x2014;and a fine one, too&#x2014;slowed. The man lowered the window, angled across the seat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Having some trouble?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Oh, yes, sir, I surely am.&#x201d; Older, she noted, maybe right around fifty, so he&#x2019;d be easy for Darryl to knock out, tie up, and drag off into the brush. &#x201c;It just up and died on me. I tried getting hold of my brother&#x2014;it&#x2019;s his truck&#x2014;but my &#x2019;link must be broken, or maybe I forgot to pay the service fee. I&#x2019;m always forgetting something.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t forget to fuel up, did you?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &#x201c;Oh, no, sir. That is, my brother, Henry, had it topped right off. That&#x2019;s Henry Beam (the name of her U.S. history teacher back in high school) from Fayetteville? Maybe you know him&#x2014;it seems everybody knows Henry.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m not from around here. Let me pull up in front of you, and I&#x2019;ll take a look.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Thank you so much. I just didn&#x2019;t know what I was going to do. It&#x2019;s getting dark, too.&#x201d;<br> He pulled up. His car was a shiny silver, and though she&#x2019;d have liked red&#x2014;just like her shoes&#x2014;she wouldn&#x2019;t complain. She fluttered around when he told her to unlock the hood, so he reached into the truck, released the latch himself.<br> He had a nice wrist unit, she noted, silver and shiny like the car. She wanted Darryl to have it.<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know much about trucks,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;so if it&#x2019;s not an easy fix, I can take you into Bentonville. You can use my &#x2019;link to get in touch with your brother.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s so nice of you. I was afraid somebody maybe not so nice would stop, and I didn&#x2019;t know what to do.&#x201d; She glanced toward the brush, kept up a chatter to mask the rustling Darryl made as he came out. &#x201c;My ma&#x2019;s going to be worrying soon if I&#x2019;m not back, so if you&#x2019;re going to Bentonville, that would be just fine. She&#x2019;ll thank you herself for bringing me home.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I thought you said Fayetteville.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What? Oh, Henry,&#x201d; she began.<br> Something must have shown in her eyes or he heard the quiet step of Darryl&#x2019;s boot, as he reared back, turned just as Darryl raised the tire iron. It struck the man on the shoulder.<br> And he leaped at Darryl like a demon from hell.<br> It happened so fast&#x2014;the flying fists, the animal grunts and snarls. Thinking only of Darryl, Ella-Loo snatched up the tire iron that had spun out of his hand, tried to get a solid grip.<br> She swung, striking the now raging Good Samaritan hard across the back, realized her mistake when it didn&#x2019;t stop him. The next time, she aimed for the legs.<br> One of them buckled&#x2014;she clearly heard a crack. Even hurt he managed to swing around, backhand her. Before she could steady herself, try for the other leg, Darryl went crazy.<br> &#x201c;Put your hands on my woman, I&#x2019;ll kill you!&#x201d;<br> He pummelled, fist flying, eyes wild, teeth bared. She barely had time to scramble clear before the man, unbalanced on his bad leg, face bloody, fell back.<br> His head struck the front bumper of the truck, bounced off, then slapped against the pavement. Before she gave it a thought, she jumped in, smashed the tire iron across his face. Two hard blows.<br> He lay still now, eyes wide in his ruined face. Blood began to seep and pool under his head.<br> Ella-Loo&#x2019;s breath puffed like a steam engine, whooshing out as her body quivered. &#x201c;Is he&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is he dead?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Shit, Ella-Loo, shit.&#x201d; Staring down, Darryl pulled a bandanna out of his back pocket to mop at the sweat and blood on his face. &#x201c;He looks dead to me.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We killed him.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t do it on purpose. Shit, Ella-Loo. He hit you right in the face. I can&#x2019;t allow that. I can&#x2019;t let anybody hurt my girl.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want him to get up and hit you again, either. So I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You got to get him off the road. Get him back behind all that brush, Darryl, and quick before somebody else comes. And you take his wallet, his wrist unit. Take anything he&#x2019;s got on him. Hurry.&#x201d;<br> She found a rag in the truck, wiped down the tire iron, then tossed it into the backseat of their new car.<br> &#x201c;Take his clothes, too, baby.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Take everything. You never know, but hurry!&#x201d;<br> She began hauling their things from the bed of the truck to the car. &#x201c;Just put everything in the back, and we&#x2019;ll sort through it later.&#x201d;<br> Her heart hammered; her hands shook. But she moved fast and sure.<br> &#x201c;We need to get everything of ours out of the truck, baby, and I guess we need to wipe the steering wheel and so on. Anything we think we&#x2019;ve touched. I&#x2019;ll do that.&#x201d;<br> She did the best she could, then finished with Darryl&#x2019;s help as they didn&#x2019;t have much to transfer from truck to car. In ten minutes Darryl was behind the wheel with Ella-Loo beside him.<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go over the speed limit now. We&#x2019;re just going to put some distance between us and that man and the truck.&#x201d;<br> She held on, a mile, five, ten. At twenty-five, she broke.<br> &#x201c;Pull off, pull off! See that road there? God Almighty, pull off, Darryl, go back in the trees there.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Are you gonna be sick, honey?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I can still smell his blood. It&#x2019;s on you. It&#x2019;s on me, too.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, now. It&#x2019;s gonna be all right, now.&#x201d; He pulled off, bumped his way through some trees, stopped. &#x201c;Honey.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Did you see his face? His eyes staring at us, but not seeing us? And the blood coming out of his mouth. Of his ears.&#x201d;<br> She turned to him, her face lit like the sun, her eyes huge, full of wonder and want. &#x201c;We killed somebody. Together.&#x201d;<br> They fell on each other. For them, sex was always hot, hard and heady, but now, with the smell of fresh blood, with the knowing, it turned feral until her screams, his shouts echoed in the car.<br> When they were done, when sweat fused their flesh together like glue and the white dress was tattered, stained with blood as red as her heels, she smiled at him.<br> &#x201c;Next time, I don&#x2019;t want to do it so fast. We&#x2019;re going to take some time with the next one.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I love you, Ella-Loo.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I love you, Darryl. Nobody&#x2019;s ever loved like we do.

At a time when the technologies of globalization are eroding barriers to communication, transportation, and trade, <i>Once Within Borders</i> explores the fitful evolution of territorial organization as a worldwide practice of human societies. Master historian Charles S. Maier tracks the epochal changes that have defined territories over five centuries and draws attention to ideas and technologies that contribute to territoriality&#x2019;s remarkable resilience.</p><p>Territorial boundaries transform geography into history by providing a framework for organizing political and economic life. But properties of territory&#x2015;their meanings and applications&#x2015;have changed considerably across space and time. In the West, modern territoriality developed in tandem with ideas of sovereignty in the seventeenth century. Sovereign rulers took steps to fortify their borders, map and privatize the land, and centralize their sway over the populations and resources within their domain. The arrival of railroads and the telegraph enabled territorial expansion at home and abroad as well as the extension of control over large spaces. By the late nineteenth century, the extent of a nation&#x2019;s territory had become an index of its power, with overseas colonial possessions augmenting prestige and wealth and redefining territoriality.</p><p>Turning to the geopolitical crises of the twentieth century, Maier pays close attention to our present moment, asking in what ways modern nations and economies still live within borders and to what degree our societies have moved toward a post-territiorial world.</p></p><p>Charles S. Maier is Leverett Saltonstall Professor of History at Harvard University.Charles Maier's new and brilliantly insightful book is a history of how political borders came to be constructed, contested and&#x2015;or so it appeared&#x2015;effaced, only to revive with a vengeance. Here is a new and subtle geopolitics for the post-global era of walls and barbed wire. (Niall Ferguson, author of <i>Kissinger, 1923&#x2013;1968</i>)<br><br>No other historian of our present age could better this scholarly discourse upon states, borders, sovereignty, and geographic space in modern, post-1500 Europe, America, and the world. Professor Maier's erudition results in a fabulous, original work on what land and sea borders have meant, and still do mean, to governments and peoples, and to state and non-state actors. His easy discussion with some of the greatest European and American public thinkers, geopoliticians, historians, and philosophers is breathtaking. (Paul Kennedy, author of <i>Engineers of Victory</i>)<br><br>A brilliant synthesis of a wealth of empirical material about the birth and development of what is conventionally considered to be modernity. (Geoff Eley, author of <i>Nazism as Fascism</i>)<br><br><p>In this brilliant and sweeping narrative, Maier shows how, beginning in the seventeenth century, sovereignty and territory became intertwined as states built borders, reorganized systems of labor and capital, and forged domains of law and authority...Maier finds today&#x2019;s world awash in fast-changing and deeply conflicting ideas about territory. The<br>interdependence of economies and the emergence of cyberspace seem to have reduced the salience of physical territorial control and weakened traditional notions of sovereignty and citizenship. But if Maier is correct, territory will continue to claim an important place in the human imagination.</p> (G. John Ikenberry <i>Foreign Affairs</i>)<br><br>It&#x2019;s rare to find insightful contemporary political commentary in what is primarily a history book. Yet this tome could hardly be more timely. For anyone keen to understand the mass movements that fuelled everything from the EU referendum result to Trump&#x2019;s election victory, you could do far worse than have a flick through <i>Once Within Borders</i>, exploring how the tinderbox where these particular fires caught ablaze came into existence. (Chris Fitch <i>Geographical</i>)<br><br>Charles Maier&#x2019;s <i>Once Within Borders</i> is a splendid account of the changing notions of territory over the past five centuries. Maier is among the most distinguished living historians and this timely book has been years in the making...He shows how changing geopolitics, the advent of commercial society, rise of industrial technology and development of new techniques of governance impinged upon evolving the notions of territory. (Srinath Raghavan <i>Mint</i>)<br><br>Charles Maier ask[s] us to consider afresh the commonplace intellectual and experiential twinning of history and geography, of time and space, and by doing so open[s] up compelling new avenues for historical, geographical and social-scientific inquiry...A stimulating analysis of the history of territory as a concept. (Robert Mayhew <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>Maier&#x2019;s book is a timely reminder that borders go back much farther than debates about border walls and hard borders...Maier shows how borders contributed to the creation of polities and our ideas about them, including sovereignty, in a sweeping review of the past 500 years of western history.

By representing the three major traditions in the philosophy of love&#x2013;Platonic eros, Christian agape, and Aristotelian philia&#x2013;editor Alan Soble has not only examined the intellectual problem of what &#x201c;love&#x201d; is, but has designed a dialogue among the three traditions in genuine philosophical style.</p> <p>&#x201c;Eros is acquisitive, egocentric or even selfish; agape is a giving love. Eros is an unconstant, unfaithful love, while agape is unwavering and continues to give despite ingratitude. Eros is a love that responds to the merit or value of its object; while agape creates value in its object as a result of loving it... Finally, eros is an ascending love, the human&#x2019;s route to God; agape is a descending love, God&#x2019;s route to humans...

Latinx Studies. Women&#39;s Studies. Edited by Faride Mereb and translated by Anne Boyer and Cassandra Gillig, GRENADE IN MOUTH: SOME POEMS OF MIY� VESTRINI introduces to Anglophone readers the work of one of the vanguard voices of Venezuelan poetry with texts that cover three decades: from the year 1960 to 1990. Critics have called Miy� Vestrini the poet of &#34;militant death.&#34; Vestrini is known, too, as the Sylvia Plath of Venezuela, but if she is a Plath, we think she is one who would have set Ted Hughes on fire. Her poems are not soft or brooding laments. They are bricks hurled at empires, ex-lovers, and any saccharine-laced lie that parades itself as the only available truth.</p><p>Miy� Vestrini was born in France, 1938, emigrated to Venezuela at the age of 9, and at eighteen she joined Apocalipsis (Apocalypse), the only woman to do so in the then male-dominated scene of the Venezuelan avant-garde. She soon became a dedicated and prize-winning journalist, directing the arts section of the newspaper <em>El Nacional</em>. She published three books of poetry in her lifetime: 1971's <em>Las historias de Giovanna (The History of Giovanna)</em>, 1975's <em>El invierno pr�ximo (The Next Winter)</em>, and <em>Pocas virtudes (Little Virtues)</em>, published in 1986. Vestrini died by suicide on November 29, 1991, leaving behind two collections: a book of poems, <em>Valiente Ciudadano (Brave Citizen)</em> and a book of stories, <em>�rdenes al coraz�n (Orders to the Heart)</em>.</p><h2>The Plain Choice: A True Story of Choosing to Live an Amish Life</h2><p><p>Raised in a broken family and emotionally overlooked, Sherry Gore grew up without a solid foundation, a prisoner of her own poor choices, and at times without hope.&nbsp; A series of terrible mistakes left her feeling wrecked and alone and a sudden tragedy threw Sherry into an emotional tailspin too powerful to escape.</p><p>Sherry hangs by a thread, unable to see how she can go on living, until it happens: on a morning of no particular significance, she walks into a church and BAM the truth of Jesus&#x2019; forgiving love shatters her world and cleaves her life in two:&nbsp; She goes to bed stunned; she wakes up a Christian.</p><p>Unwilling to return to the darkness of her former life, Sherry attacks her faith head on.&nbsp; Soon the life Sherry Gore remakes for herself and her children as she seeks to follow the teachings of the Bible features head coverings, simple dress, and a focus on Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Only then does she realize, in a fit of excitement, that there are <em>others</em> like her.&nbsp; They are called Amish and Mennonite, and she realizes she has found her people.</p><p>The plain choice that Sherry makes is not easy &#x2013; and life still brings unexpected pain and heartache - but it changes everything for her, as she becomes one of the few people on earth to have successfully joined the Amish from the outside.&nbsp;</p><p>She has found her place.

It&#x2019;s not like Christmas or the Fourth of July, with their dependable calendar slots, the reassurance of a fixed number. So that it should fall on April 8 of this year&#x2014;the first of Ryan Walsh&#x2019;s uneven stint in high school&#x2014;seems reason enough for her to be on a southbound &#x2018;L&#x2019; train at the exact moment she should be taking her seat in science class. The day is beautiful, blindingly bright and faintly breezy, and the Chicago skyline looms a startling shade of silver in the distance. Ryan clutches her backpack as the train lurches from side to side, her forehead pressed against the thick plastic window.<br> <br>A man in a Ryne Sandberg jersey wafts a foam finger in her direction, and even as she scoots farther toward the window, Ryan&#x2019;s heart beats fast with excitement. There are college kids drinking sweet-flavored vodka drinks from plastic bottles, old men with sweat-stained blue caps, a group of boys trading blue and red markers to finish up a cardboard sign. At each stop, as they collect more fans, as the noise level grows, as they wind their way along Lake Michigan toward the center of it all, she feels it: the fluttery hope, the tentative promise. It is game day in Chicago, the first true day of spring. There is, before them all, a whole new season.<br> <br>Ryan is not typically reckless in this way. She is, in fact, feeling slightly nauseated at the thought of her impulsive departure after third period. Across the packed train car, she thinks she spots a boy from her math class, the shock of white from a cast on his arm peeking through at elbow level in the crowd. But at the next stop, when the doors open and a new surge of people presses their way inside, he&#x2019;s suddenly gone, and Ryan decides she&#x2019;s only looking for a reason to feel guilty and to think of school.<br> <br>&#x201c;Next stop, Addison,&#x201d; the conductor calls out, and the train erupts in wild cheering. Ryan tugs at the drawstrings of her hooded sweatshirt and smiles to herself.<br> <br>This, after all, is where she feels closest to him. Not when she sits at what had once been his seat at the dinner table. Not when her mom unwittingly sings their song under her breath while she does the dishes. Not when she looks at her younger sister, whose eyes are his: gray-blue and swimming.<br> <br>No, right here, with the stadium fast approaching and all the possibilities of these nine long innings laid bare: this is where it&#x2019;s easiest to imagine her father still beside her.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d been just ten when he was killed in a rafting accident while on a trip to Colorado. Soon after, Mom sold their season tickets&#x2014;two seats on the third base line, just eight rows back&#x2014;to help save money while she looked for a job. Emily had always been too young anyway, and Mom was never interested much beyond the novelty of the festival-like atmosphere of Wrigley Field.<br> <br>But the ivy-covered back wall is the background to most of Ryan&#x2019;s memories of him. She can see his face most clearly when she thinks of him at the ballpark. It was here he&#x2019;d taught her to keep score when she was only six, patiently helping her fill in the tiny diamond grids across her playbook, and it was here&#x2014;however unknowingly&#x2014;she&#x2019;d begun to prepare herself for his absence. Where better to learn of heartbreak and loss than Wrigley Field? What better place to harden your heart?<br> <br>At the games, he&#x2019;d throw an arm across the back of her seat and lean in. &#x201c;If the Cubs win,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give up chocolate for a whole week.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It has to be something more important than that,&#x201d; Ryan would say accusingly, as if he didn&#x2019;t care enough to negotiate with something better than candy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not for this game,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d protest. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not even our division.&#x201d;<br> <br>She&#x2019;d pull her blue cap down low and frown until he reconsidered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, fine,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say with a grin. &#x201c;If the Cubs win, I&#x2019;ll eat only vegetables for the rest of the week.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about if they win, you have to give me five piggybacks a day?&#x201d;<br> <br><i>&#x201c;Five a day?&#x201d;</i> he&#x2019;d say, laughing. &#x201c;You drive a hard bargain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for the good of the team,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d insist.<br> <br>It was a dangerous bargaining tool, this team of theirs. There was always the chance they&#x2019;d be left with nothing.<br> <br>Since her dad died, Ryan has only been to three games. The first two with her mom and sister soon after the accident, where they got lost amid the thick crowds and the too-cheerful organ music. Ryan had barely been able to watch the game, instead working to split open peanut shells the way he&#x2019;d taught her, but they felt dry and dusty in her mouth. Emily cried when someone in the row behind them spilled beer at their feet, and Mom held her close, looking out over the top of her head with a dazed expression, even when everyone else rose for the national anthem. They&#x2019;d left at the top of the fourth inning, and on their second try a few games later, made it only to the bottom of the fifth. It was soon after that when Mom sold the tickets.<br> <br>A year later, sitting with a friend and her parents at the third game, Ryan realized she&#x2019;d forgotten how to keep score the way her dad taught her. She sat with her pencil poised over the scorecard and blinked back tears.<br> <br>That was five years ago. She hasn&#x2019;t been back since.<br> <br>But today is different. Today is April 8.<br> <br>When the train slows to a halt, the passengers shift restlessly until the doors open. Over their shoulders, Ryan can see the huge wall of the stadium rising up against a cloudless sky, and she draws in a breath. The air smells of that peculiar combination of hot dogs and springtime, leather mitts and freshly cut grass, and all of it blends into one scent, one thought, one thing: <i>Dad</i>.<br> <br>&#x201c;Opening Day programs,&#x201d; a man in red calls out, waving the glossy booklets high in the air. &#x201c;Cubs programs here!&#x201d;<br> <br>Ryan steps off the platform, swept toward the stadium along with the rest of the crowd, and just briefly, she closes her eyes. April 8 may not always be Opening Day, but it <i>is</i> always&#x2014;without fail and without end&#x2014;the anniversary of the day her father died. And this, she thinks, peering up at the pennants waving lazily in the spring breeze, is reason enough.<br> <br>Ryan had woken this morning with a dull sense of loss, and when she rolled over to glance at her clock, she remembered and burrowed deeper beneath the covers. Five years ago on this day, she&#x2019;d been pulled from her fourth-grade classroom and made to sit in the nurse&#x2019;s office until her mom arrived, red-eyed and stunned with her three-year-old sister in tow, to tell her what she knew&#x2014;that in the chaos of the Colorado River, on the trip her dad had been planning with his college buddies for years, the raft had overturned. Of the group, it had been her father who was tossed in the worst possible direction, where the water was quicker, the river bottom rockier. It was the school nurse who leaned in to clarify the message: &#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone, honey,&#x201d; she said, and Ryan began to cry.<br> <br>Sometimes, it seems she hasn&#x2019;t stopped crying since.<br> <br>This morning, when she came downstairs for breakfast, Emily was already sitting at the table singing to herself, her legs swinging from the chair as she picked at a blueberry muffin. Her younger sister loves dolls and horses, stickers and puppies, and is so far from what Ryan had been at eight&#x2014;or ever&#x2014;that she often has trouble believing they could have been raised in the same family.<br> <br>Though in a way, they haven&#x2019;t been.<br> <br>Emily had been too young to remember Dad, and for that, Ryan can&#x2019;t fault her. But her sister&#x2019;s allegiance to Kevin makes Ryan feel like the last survivor of a long-lost era. Their stepfather is a nice enough lawyer who Mom met at the driving range when she decided to take golf lessons a couple years ago. At the real estate agency where she&#x2019;d started working after Dad died, golf was apparently more than just a hobby. It was the common language. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a sport that&#x2019;s actually useful,&#x201d; Mom said, looking pointedly at Ryan. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good for business.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad had been a sportswriter, and even <i>he</i> didn&#x2019;t consider golf a real sport.<br> <br>Kevin&#x2014;wearer of ties, believer in rules, hater of baseball&#x2014;had joined the family shortly afterward, and it is with him that Emily has grown up. Because of this, it&#x2019;s impossible to blame her for not understanding that you don&#x2019;t flip the television channel when the Cubs are on.<br> <br>This morning, Ryan had looked on wearily from across the kitchen table as Emily folded and refolded a muffin wrapper like a study in origami. Twice, she opened her mouth to say something&#x2014;to offer some small reminder of the day&#x2014;but her sister was bright-eyed and ready for school, waiting for Kevin to drive her, waiting for Mom to kiss them good-bye, and Ryan didn&#x2019;t have the heart to draw her into this awful anniversary, no matter how much she wished for someone to share in her sorrow. When Mom came downstairs, she would&#x2014;as she did each year on this day&#x2014;hug Ryan just a little bit tighter, linger just a moment longer when she kissed her forehead, smooth back the tangles of hair from her face. They would exchange watery smiles, and without having to say anything, without making any sort of fuss, they would sit down to a breakfast of slightly burned bacon and scrambled eggs&#x2014;Dad&#x2019;s favorite. Anything more to commemorate the day would be too difficult; anything less, heartless.<br> <br>But today, Mom came down holding Kevin&#x2019;s hand, the two of them hiding smiles and practically giggling. They stood before the table, Kevin adjusting his tie, Mom with a hand on the back of Emily&#x2019;s chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Ryan asked, frowning. She sat Indian style on the kitchen chair, her arms tucked up inside her sweatshirt. Mom stooped down to place a hand on top of Emily&#x2019;s, and behind her, Kevin shifted from one foot to the other, bobbing his head of thinning hair and grinning stupidly.<br> <br>&#x201c;We only just found out for sure,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pregnant.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom looked to them both, smiling hesitantly, until Emily squealed and hopped up from her chair, clapping her hands, and Mom&#x2019;s smile broadened. She raised her eyes over Ryan&#x2019;s shoulder to Kevin, and with that look&#x2014;the flecks of light in her eyes, the faintest hint of joy&#x2014;Ryan&#x2019;s heart dropped. <i>Of all days,</i> she thought, as she pushed back from the table and pounded up the stairs to her room.<br> <br>Later, when she heard the knock, Ryan simply tucked her face into her pillow and grunted. She looked up when the door creaked open, and Mom poked her head in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mind if I join you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ryan said nothing, but curled into a ball to make room at the foot of the bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t forget,&#x201d; Mom said, resting a hand on Ryan&#x2019;s ankle. She tilted her head thoughtfully. &#x201c;I think, in a way, he&#x2019;d be happy about it, actually. A new beginning on a day like today. It&#x2019;s just the kind of thing he&#x2019;d find meaning in if he were here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If he were here,&#x201d; Ryan said, staring fiercely out the window, &#x201c;this wouldn&#x2019;t have happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>They sat quietly on the bed together, the sounds from the cars outside rising up through the half-open window. Ryan waited for Mom to say something more&#x2014;to suggest they go downstairs for bacon and eggs, or to tell her she&#x2019;ll never love anyone more than Dad, not Kevin and not even this new baby&#x2014;but they both remained silent.<br> <br>Finally, Ryan eyed her stomach. &#x201c;When&#x2019;s it due?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;October,&#x201d; Mom said, placing a hand on her belly, obviously pleased by the question. Ryan shrugged, watching the Cubs flag on her closet door flutter in the breeze from the window. It wasn&#x2019;t as if she&#x2019;d have anything else to do in October.<br> <br>� 2008 Jennifer E. Smith</p><h2>The Omega Principle: Seafood and the Quest for a Long Life and a Healthier Planet</h2><p><b>By the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Four Fish</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>American Catch</i>, an eye-opening investigation of the history, science, and business behind omega-3 fatty acids, the "miracle compound" whose story is intertwined with human health and the future of our planet</b><br><br>Omega-3 fatty acids have long been celebrated by doctors and dieticians as key to a healthy heart and a sharper brain. In the last few decades, that promise has been encapsulated in one of America's most popular dietary supplements. Omega-3s are today a multi-billion dollar business, and sales are still growing apace--even as recent medical studies caution that the promise of omega-3s may not be what it first appeared.&nbsp;<br><br>But a closer look at the omega-3 sensation reveals something much deeper and more troubling. The miracle pill is only the latest product of the reduction industry, a vast, global endeavor that over the last century has boiled down trillions of pounds of marine life into animal feed, fertilizer, margarine, and dietary supplements. The creatures that are the victims of that industry seem insignificant to the untrained eye, but turn out to be essential to the survival of whales, penguins, and fish of all kinds, including many that we love to eat.<br><br>Behind these tiny molecules is a big story: of the push-and-pull of science and business; of the fate of our oceans in a human-dominated age; of the explosion of land food at the expense of healthier and more sustainable seafood; of the human quest for health and long life at all costs. James Beard Award-winning author Paul Greenberg probes the rich and surprising history of omega-3s--from the dawn of complex life, when these compounds were first formed; to human prehistory, when the discovery of seafood may have produced major cognitive leaps for our species; and on to the modern era, when omega-3s may point the way to a bold new direction for our food system. With wit and boundless curiosity, Greenberg brings us along on his travels--from Peru to Antarctica, from the Canary Islands to the Amalfi Coast--to reveal firsthand the practice and repercussions of our unbalanced way of eating.<br><br>Rigorously reported and winningly told,&nbsp;<i>The Omega Principle</i>&nbsp;is a powerful argument for a more deliberate and forward-thinking relationship to the food we eat and the oceans that sustain us.</p><p>Paul Greenberg is the author of the James Beard Award-winning <i>Four Fish </i>and <i>American Catch</i> and a regular contributor to <i>The New York Times</i>.

In its way it is a classical whodunit that stands comparison with old-school practitioners such as Agatha Christie or Dorothy Sayers. This mystery transpires in the rarefied precincts of the English department of a venerable college, an English department very much of the restless postwar moment, echoing with references to Freud and Kafka. Eustis finds comedy high and low in a cavalcade of characters bursting at the seams with repressed sexual longings and simmering malice. Beyond the satire, she stirs up--with a narrative whose multiple viewpoints give the book a deliberately modernistic edge--a troubling sense of the mental chaos lurking just beneath the civilized surfaces of her academic setting.</p><p><b>Helen White Eustis</b> (1916-2015) was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and attended Smith College in Massachusetts, where she won a creative writing award. <i>The Horizontal Man </i>(1946), loosely based on her experiences at Smith, won the Edgar Award for Best First Novel the following year.

They had met before, of course. The county of Norfolk is not so populous that they could have avoided each other. Their conduct at these meetings had been shaped by Ginny's lofty and willful ignorance of the situation: by Emma's sangfroid: by Felix's natural desire to maintain an arrangement that suited him.Over the years they had coincided in drafty parish halls, in charity committee rooms, and at the caucuses of local groups concerned with the protection of what, in the decade just beginning, would be known as "the environment." They had bumped into each other in Norwich, shopping in Jarrold's department store; they had exchanged small talk at exhibitions of craftwork, and occupied neighboring seats at the theater.Once, traveling to London, they had found themselves sole occupants of a first-class carriage. For half an hour they had found enough that was anodyne to pass the time. Then Ginny, excusing herself with a smile, delved into her bag and pulled out a fat paperback book. She retired behind it. Emma examined its cover. A svelte woman, with a small crown perched upon her wimple, stoodbefore a manor house with anachronistic chimney stacks. The title was in florid gold script: <i>Wyfe to Crookback.</i> Emma looked out of the window. The landscape was a sad East England green; crows wheeled over the fields. As they moved from the edge of England to its heart, Emma herself took out a book.They parted at sooty Liverpool Street with a nod and a smile. London forced no collusion on them, but Norfolk did. A handful of farming and professional families played host to both. At a round of weddings and christenings they had made polite, even warm conversation. At a dozen New Year's Eve parties they had wished each other luck and happiness: and sometimes almost meant it.Now, on this February morning, Ginny stood surrounded by a knot of mourners. Friends and business associates had turned out for the occasion; Felix had been well liked in the district. The church occupied high ground, and a ripping wind billowed coats and snapped at woolen head scarves and brought a flush to aching faces. The mourners could sense the presence of the sea, hidden from them by a belt of pines.Some of them lingered in the church porch, reading the notices about flower rotas, dusting, and brass cleaning; others stood among the gravestones, looking depressed. They had double-parked in the open area beyond the church gate, and would have to wait their turn to get away. Ginny, leaning on the arm of her son, moved from group to group, offering a few tactful words to soothe their feelings; she understood that death is embarrassing.Her own family--her son, Daniel, who was an architect, her daughter, Claire, who was a buyer at Harrods--had been as gentle and as careful of her feelings as anyone could wish. But--even as she deferred the moment--Ginny felt that it was Emma to whom she wished to speak, to whom naturally she should be speaking. Patting her son's arm, smiling up and dismissing him, she made her way across the grass with a short, precisely regulated stride, her high heels spiking holes in the ground like some primitive seed drill.Ginny Palmer was a sharp, neat, Wallis Simpson sort of woman, to whom black lent an added definition. As she advanced onEmma, she took from her pocket a crisp lace-edged handkerchief, folded it very small and polished the tip of her nose: a gesture quite unnecessary, but somehow drawn out of her by the occasion. You see me, the widow: fastidious but distraught.Emma Eldred kept her hands in her pockets; she had forgotten her gloves. She wore the coat that she had worn for years, to go out on her doctor's rounds, to go shopping, to go out walking, and to meet Felix. She saw no need for any other coat, in her ordinary life or on a day like this; it was dark, it was decent, and--she felt obscurely--it was something Felix would have recognized.Emma Eldred was not a large woman, but gave the appearance of it: forty-eight years old, her face innocent of cosmetics, her broad feet safely encased in scuffed shoes decorated by leather tassels which somehow failed to cut a dash. Emma had known Ginny's husband since childhood. She might have married him; but Felix was not what Emma considered a serious man. Their relationship had, she felt, borne all the weight it could. As Ginny approached, Emma shrunk into herself, inwardly but not outwardly. A stranger, only partly apprised of the situation, would have taken Ginny for the smart little mistress, and Emma for the tatty old wife.The women stood together for a moment, not speaking; then as the wind cut her to the bird bones, Ginny took a half step closer, and stood holding her mink collar up to her throat. "Well, Ginny," Emma said, after a moment. "I'm not here to act as a windbreak." She drew her right hand from her pocket, and gave Ginny a pat on the shoulder. It was a brusque gesture, less of consolation than of encouragement; what you might give a weary nag, as it faces the next set of hurdles.Ginny averted her face. Tears sprang into her eyes. She took out her tiny handkerchief again. "Why, Emma?" she said. She sounded fretful, but as if her fretfulness might turn to rage. "Tell me why. You're a doctor.""But not his doctor.""He wasn't ill. He never had a day's illness."Emma fixed her gaze on the tassels of her shoes. She imaginedherself looking right through her dead lover; through his customary tweed jacket, his lambswool pullover, his striped shirt, through the skin, through the flesh, into the arteries where Felix's blood moved slowly, a dark underground stream with silted banks. "No one could have known," she said. "No one could have spared you this shock, Ginny. Will you be all right, my dear?""There's plenty of insurance," Ginny said. "And the house. I'll move of course. But not just yet.""Don't do anything in a hurry," Emma said. She had meant her question in a broad sense, not as an inquiry into Ginny's financial standing. She raised her head, and saw that they were being watched. The eyes of the other mourners were drawn to them, however hard those mourners tried to look away. What do they all think, Emma wondered: that there will be some sort of embarrassing scene? Hardly likely. Not at this time. Not in this place. Not among people like ourselves, who have been reared in the service of the great god Self-Control. "Ginny," she said, "you mustn't stand about here. Let Daniel drive you home.""A few people are coming back," Ginny said. She looked at Emma in faint surprise, as if it were natural that she would know the arrangements. "You should come back too. Let me give you some whiskey. A freezing day like this ... Still, better than rain. Claire's staying on over the weekend." Ginny raised her hand, and twitched at her collar again. "Emma, I'd like to see you. Like you to come to the house ... Mrs. Gleave is making vol-au-vents ..." Her voice tailed off entirely.Emma's brother, Ralph Eldred, loomed purposefully behind them: a solid figure, hands scrunched into the pockets of his dark wool overcoat. Ginny looked up. The sight of Ralph seemed to restore her. "Ralph, thank you for coming," she said. "Come back with us and have some whiskey.""I should take myself off," Ralph said. "I have to go to Norwich this afternoon to a meeting. But naturally if you want me to, Ginny ... if I can be of any help ..." He was weighing considerations,as he always did; his presence was wanted on every hand, and it was simply a question of where he was needed most."Why, no," Ginny said. "It was a courtesy, Ralph. Do run along."She managed a smile. It was her husband's underoccupation that had freed him for his long years of infidelity; but Ralph's days were full, and everybody knew it. There were advantages, she saw, in being married to a man who thought only of work, God, and family; even though the Eldred children did look so down-at-heel, and had been so strangely brought up, and even though Ralph's wife was worn to a shadow slaving for his concerns.Ralph's wife Anna wore a neat black pillbox hat. It looked very smart, though it was not remotely in fashion. Lingering in the background, she gave Ginny a nod of acknowledgment and sympathy. It was an Anna Eldred nod, full of I-do-not-intrude. Ginny returned it; then Ralph took his wife's arm, and squired her away at a good clip toward their parked car.Ginny looked after them. "You wonder about marriage," she said suddenly. "Are marriages all different, or all alike?"Emma shrugged, shoulders stiff inside her old coat. "No use asking me, Ginny."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Inside the car, Ralph said, "It's not right, you know. It's not, is it? For Emma to find out like that. More or less by chance. And only when it was all over.""It was all over very quickly," Anna said. "From what I gather.""Yes, but to have no priority in being told--""I expect you think Ginny should have rung her from the hospital, do you? Just given her a tinkle from the intensive care unit?""--to have no right to know. That's what galls me. It's inhuman. And now Ginny gets all the sympathy, all the attention. I'm not saying she doesn't need and deserve it. But Emma gets nothing, not a word. Only this public embarrassment.""I see--you think that as Emma was the <i>ma�tresse en titre,</i> she should be allowed to put on a show of her own?" Anna sighed. "I'm sure Felix has left her some fine diamonds, and a chateau for her old age."A contractor's van drew up in front of the Eldreds' car, adding to the traffic jam; restoration work was going on at the church. Two workmen got out, and began to untie a ladder from the roofrack. A lesser man with Ralph's schedule would have fretted at the delay. But Ralph showed his impatience only by a little tapping of his forefinger against the steering wheel. There was a school nearby, and the voices of children drifted from the playground, carried on the wind like gulls' cries.The couple who blocked them drove off, nodding, raising hands in a stiff-fingered wave. The contractor moved his van. Ralph pulled out onto the road. Anna saw the children dashing and bumping and careening behind a fence: bullets trussed in duffle coats, their faces hidden under hoods.The route home lay inland, through narrow lanes between farms; flat airy fields, where tractors lay at rest. Ralph pulled up to let a duck dawdle across the road, on its way from a barnyard to nowhere. "I'll tell you," he said. "I'll tell you what's the worst of it. Emma's got nothing. Nothing. She's given twenty years to Felix and now she's on her own.""Emma's given something," Anna said. "I think to say that she's given twenty years is being melodramatic.""Why is it," Ralph said, "that women manage to be so cool in these situations? What's all this keeping up a good front? Why do they think they have to do it? I heard Ginny talking about <i>insurance policies,</i> for God's sake.""I only mean, that Emma's life has suited her. She had what she wanted--a part-time man. Felix didn't use her. The reverse, I think. She could have married. If she'd chosen to. She didn't have to wait on Felix.""Married? Could she?" Ralph turned his head."Look out," Anna said, with a languor born of experience.Ralph put his foot on the brake; a farm truck slowly extruded its back end from a muddy and half-concealed driveway."Sorry," Ralph said. "Could she? Who could she have married then?""Oh Ralph, I don't mean any one person, not this particular man or that particular man ... I only mean that if she had wanted to marry, if that had been what she preferred, she could have done it. But marriage entails things, like learning to boil eggs. Things that are beyond Emma.""I can't see men beating a path to her door." Ralph edged the car painfully down the lane, squeezing it past the truck, which had got stuck. "Not Emma. No beauty.""Felix liked her.""Felix was a creature of habit.""Most men are."Ralph fell silent. He was very fond of his sister; no one should think otherwise. Emma was kind, clever, wise ... and lonely, he'd supposed: a little figure glimpsed on a river bank, while the pleasure craft sped by. This notion of her as a manipulator, of Felix as a little fish that she played at the end of her stick and hook ... Seems unlikely to me, he thought. But then, what do I know?The journey took them a half hour, through back roads and lanes, through straggling hamlets of red brick or flint cottages, whose only amenity was a postbox; between agribusiness fields, wide open to a vast gray sky. Ralph pulled up with a jolt at the gate of their house. Anna shot forward, one hand on the dashboard and one on her hat. "Can I leave you here? I'm late."As she unraveled her seat belt, Ralph turned to look at her. "Those people at the funeral, all those friends of Felix's, how many of them do you think knew about him and Emma?"Anna took her house keys from her bag. "Every one of them.""How did Ginny bear it?""Easily. Or so everyone says." Anna swung her door open and her legs out, setting her high heels daintily into the mud. "What time will you be back?""Seven o'clock. Maybe eight."Nine, then, Anna thought. "Everybody knew except you," she said. "I suppose you still feel a fool.""I suppose I do." Ralph reached over to close the passenger door. "But then, I still don't see why I should have known. Not as if their affair was the flamboyant sort. Not as if it was ..."--he searched for the word--" ... torrid."Torrid, Anna thought. She watched him drive away. Interesting how our vocabulary responds, providing us with words we have never needed before, words stacked away for us, neatly folded into our brain and there for our use: like a bride's lifetime supply of linen, or a ducal trove of monogrammed china. Death will overtake us before a fraction of those words are used.A CHANGE OF CLIMATE. Copyright � 1994 by Hilary Mantel. All rights reserved.

Interviewing black and white working-class men who, because they are not college graduates, have limited access to high-paying jobs and other social benefits, she constructs a revealing portrait of how they see themselves and the rest of society.</p><p>Morality is at the center of these workers' worlds. They find their identity and self-worth in their ability to discipline themselves and conduct responsible but caring lives. These moral standards function as an alternative to economic definitions of success, offering them a way to maintain dignity in an out-of-reach American dreamland. But these standards also enable them to draw class boundaries toward the poor and, to a lesser extent, the upper half. Workers also draw rigid racial boundaries, with white workers placing emphasis on the "disciplined self" and blacks on the "caring self." Whites thereby often construe blacks as morally inferior because they are lazy, while blacks depict whites as domineering, uncaring, and overly disciplined.</p><p>This book also opens up a wider perspective by examining American workers in comparison with French workers, who take the poor as "part of us" and are far less critical of blacks than they are of upper-middle-class people and immigrants. By singling out different "moral offenders" in the two societies, workers reveal contrasting definitions of "cultural membership" that help us understand and challenge the forms of inequality found in both societies.</p></p><p>Mich�le Lamont is Robert I. Goldman Professor of European Studies and Professor of Sociology and African and African American Studies at Harvard University.&#x201c;<i>The Dignity of Working Men</i> is an outstanding example of comparative ethnography. Through a series of careful and thoughtful interviews, Mich�le Lamont reveals the moral standards ordinary workers use in evaluating their fellow citizens. In this engaging book, Lamont also provides an interesting comparison between workers in the United States and France on the criteria used to draw class and racial boundaries.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Julius Wilson, Harvard University and author of <i>When Work Disappears</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Lamont's book is a classic in the making. It breaks new ground as a major in-depth study of comparative racism. It will also broaden the horizons of social class studies. <i>The Dignity of Working Men</i> opens up a wider perspective, so that by looking at French racial conflict, American racial conflict looks less fixed, less inevitable. There are alternative patterns, revealing that societies do have room to maneuver.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Randall Collins, University of Pennsylvania and author of <i>The Sociology of Philosophies</i> (Harvard)</b><br><br>&#x201c;Lamont's richly-textured comparison does more than hold up for view the moral perspectives of working-class men across the racial divide in the United States and France. It poses fresh and rich challenges to research, demonstrates the difference systematic qualitative analysis can make, and points the way to a politics of sensibility and possibility.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ira I. Katznelson, Columbia University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Dignity of Working Men</i> is a wonderful book. What is most striking is the richness of the interviews. Lamont's questions seem really to have touched working men where they live, to have encouraged them to talk about their sense of self, their pride in themselves as workers, their sense of moral order, their aspirations and (occasional) political passions, their families, their beliefs in equality and inequality, their racial attitudes, and much more. By asking black workers what they think of whites as well as what whites think of blacks, and by comparing racial and ethnic cleavages in France and the United States, <i>The Dignity of Working Men</i> adds a vital new dimension to studies of class and race.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ann Swidler, University of California, Berkeley</b><br><br>&#x201c;Many interpreters of current society have posited that class is no longer a useful concept as a basis for identity. This book, based on hundreds of interviews with American and French workers, rejects that analysis...It is fascinating reading, an important contribution to a reexamination of class.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J. Wishnia</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Was there actually a set of values that could be considered distinctly "working class" in character, that represented a distinctly working-class worldview? One of the most sophisticated recent attempts to answer this question appeared in the recent study <i>The Dignity of Working Men</i>...[Lamont] recognized that asking workers to choose their most important values from a prepared list would essentially force their replies into a predetermined mold that had little to do with their real-world thoughts and feelings. Lamont used instead open-ended and non-directive questions. She interviewed 150 blue-collar workers, black and white, in the United States and in France, and compared them with middle-class people in both countries. Her questions asked workers to describe people who were similar to them and people who were different, people they liked and disliked, and those to whom they felt superior or inferior. Follow-up questions probed why they felt as they did, spontaneously eliciting a complex pattern of moral judgements and values. Both work and family did indeed emerge among the blue-collar workers' core values. But the real significance lay in how those were perceived.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andrew Levinson</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It is hard to imagine a comparative research design as well conceived as the one that frames Mich�le Lamont's book.... The book is a model of cross cultural comparative analysis and deserves high praise.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Rick Fantasia, Contemporary Sociology</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Dignity of Working Men</i> is an important entry into examinations of the intersection of class, race, and immigration. (Lamont) gives us new leverage on both some viable antiracist threads of thinking among the white working class and on the complexity and humanism animating how African Americans engage the great divides of race and class. We shall all be discussing this meticulously researched, cogently argued, and provocative book for some years to come.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lawrence Bobo, Contemporary Sociology</b><br><br>&#x201c;Michele Lamont's study of working-class men in the USA and France is...the most interesting contribution to this field for quite some time, and should serve as a benchmark for future scholarly debate...This is a really innovative and challenging book and it needs to be read as widely as possible...<i>The Dignity of Working Men</i> has all the potential to become a classic.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Solomos</b><b>, </b><b><i>Ethnic and Racial Studies</i></b></p><h2>The Intelligent Enneagram</h2><p>At last, an enneagram book that explains the <i>full</i> potential of this mysterious nine-pointed symbol, with applications reaching far beyond personality typology. The enneagram, an ancient diagram first popularized by G. I. Gurdjieff, represents the evolution of <i>any</i> process and is thus a remarkable tool for analyzing and understanding many different areas of endeavor. <br><br>Like the <i>I Ching </i> hexagrams or the kabbalistic Tree of Life, the enneagram is an ingenious device providing access to a higher order of information and can lead us to new and creative ways of thinking and problem-solving. Drawing on the teachings of John Bennett, a major interpreter of the Gurdjieff Work, the author shows how using the enneagram can enhance our powers of intuition, our capacity to see situations holistically, and our ability to find connections between different regions of knowledge and experience. After discussing in detail the fundamental ideas woven into the symbol, the author applies the insights in the enneagram to a series of topics ranging from the solar system to sex, from science fiction movies to the Lord's Prayer.</p><p>Anthony George Edward Blake trained in physics and the philosophy of science, and studied the Gurdjieff Work with John Bennett.

All of the company&#39;s works-from stained-glass windows to blown-glass vases; lamp shades to inkwells-bore the unique stamp of one man, Louis Comfort Tiffany, who created the Tiffany Studios and supervised every aspect of their production. Many of these official studio pieces are well known today-avidly sought by museums and collectors worldwide. Special ones among them, as well as other lesser known pieces-the &#34;lost&#34; works of Louis Tiffany himself-are, in a real sense, the core of his astonishing achievement. They comprise his personal oeuvre-the objects made from his original designs for exhibition, for private commissions, or for use in Tiffany&#39;s own homes. This book reevaluates Tiffany&#39;s art in terms of his personal work-including pieces in all the media that attracted him over the course of his prolific career; stained glass, of course, but also mosaics, blown glass, pottery, jewelry, and enamels. Tiffany&#39;s pioneering efforts in interior design are covered, as are his easel paintings and his dream of creating a permanent residential retreat for working artists. Hugh F. McKean also provides much intimate insight into Tiffany&#39;s personality, his domestic life, his financial dealings, and his unusual philosophy of art. Lavishly illustrated, the book presents a vivid display of Tiffany&#39;s wide-ranging aesthetic. The result is a rare portrait of Tiffany the man-and of the prodigious imagination that almost single-handedly transformed the day-to-day image of a nation and an era.</p><p>As a young artist, Hugh F. McKean spent time in residence at Tiffany&#39;s estate, Laurelton Hall-courtesy of the original Tiffany Foundation. Laurelton Hall has since been destroyed by fire, but Mr. McKean&#39;s personal experience of its many treasures and his acquaintance with the aging Tiffany himself have given him a unique insight into the subject of this book.</p><h2>The Use of Poetry and Use of Criticism: Studies in the Relation of Criticism to Poetry in England (The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures)</h2><p>The 1932-33 Norton Lectures are among the best and most important of Eliot's critical writings. Tracing the rise of literary self-consciousness from the Elizabethan period to his own day, Eliot does not simply examine the relation of criticism to poetry, but invites us to "start with the supposition that we do not know what poetry is, or what it does or ought to do, or of what use it is; and try to find out, in examining the relation of poetry to criticism, what the use of both of them is."<br><br>Eliot begins with the appearance of poetry criticism in the age of Dryden, when poetry became the province of an intellectual aristocracy rather than part of the mind and popular tradition of a whole people. Wordsworth and Coleridge, in their attempt to revolutionize the language of poetry at the end of the eighteenth century, made exaggerated claims for poetry and the poet, culminating in Shelley's assertion that "poets are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind." And, in the doubt and decaying moral definitions of the nineteenth century, Arnold transformed poetry into a surrogate for religion.<br><br>By studying poetry and criticism in the context of its time, Eliot suggests that we can learn what is permanent about the nature of poetry, and makes a powerful case for both its autonomy and its pluralism in this century.</p><p>Thomas Stearns Eliot was born in St Louis, Missouri, in 1888. He moved to England in 1914 and published his first book of poems in 1917. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948. Eliot died in 1965.&#x201c;The most influential critic of the twentieth century reconsiders the English critical tradition. This book is central to the Modernist remapping of literary history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Perkins</b></p><h2>Sense &amp; Sensibility (Marvel Illustrated)</h2><p>Award-winning writer Nancy Butler, adapter of Marvel's best-selling adaptation of PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE, returns to Marvel with another Jane Austen classic: SENSE &amp; SENSIBILITY! Alongside incredible artist Sonny Liew (MY FAITH IN FRANKIE, WONDERLAND), Butler brings to life the world of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two daughters without parents or means, forced to experience hardship, romance, and heartbreak, all in the hopes of achieving love and lasting happiness.<br><br> <strong>COLLECTING:</strong><br><br> Sense &amp; Sensibility #1-5<br><br></p><p>Nancy Butler is the award-winning author of 12 Signet Regencies and 3 novellas.<br><br>Winner of the 1998 Golden Leaf Award for Best First Novel and two Rita Awards.This graphic-novel version of the story of two sisters who live at different ends of the intellectual and emotional spectrum is a success both in its claim to merely adapting Austen and in the visual and narrative apertures it gives new readers of her nineteenth-century prose. The story unfolds almost entirely in dialogue (whereas Austens original was carried largely by letters exchanged), and Liews artwork is fully colored in soft and luminescent period hues, and his figures have a nearly bobble-headed tininess that makes them a welcome fit in antique parlors. Butlers introduction is wise, and the storys vocabulary and syntax are gently updated to make for smooth reading by those unfamiliar with Austen. The genteel poverty, the romance, and the family affairs remain authentic and vivid, with a subtle glaze of humor in the characters thought balloons and expressive faces.

He chose 13 subjects he has been interested in out of the traditional Korean culture and folded into six categories. This book is intended not only for foreign readers who would like to learn more about traditional Korean culture but do not have easy access to it, but also for Korean readers as well who are in search of this country&#39;s beauty.</p><p>Bae Yong Joon is one of East Asia&#39;s foremost actors and an ardent supporter of intercultural communication and exchange. Bae made his acting debut in 1994 on the KBS television series, Salut D&#39;Amour (Love Greeting), and rose to stardom with his role in the 1995 series, A Sunny Place of the Young.

It offers a sustained reflection on modernity&#x2015;people and movements&#x2015;in poetic meter. Just as Dante, in his <i>Divine Comedy</i>, summed up the Middle Ages on the cusp of modernity, <i>The Five Quintets </i>takes stock of a late modern world on the cusp of the first-ever global century.</p><p>Celebrated Irish poet Micheal O&#x2019;Siadhail structures his <i>Quintets</i> to echo the <i>Comedy</i>. Where Dante had a tripartite structure ( <i>Inferno</i>, <i>Purgatorio</i>, and <i>Paradiso</i>), O&#x2019;Siadhail has a five-part structure, with each quintet devoted to a discipline&#x2015;the arts; economics; politics; science; and philosophy and theology. Each quintet is also marked by a different form: sonnets interspersed by haikus ("saikus"), iambic pentameter, terza rima, and two other invented forms.</p><p> <i>The Five Quintets </i>captivates even as it instructs, exploring the ever-changing flow of ideas and the individuals whose contributions elicited change and reflected their times. The artists, economists, politicians, scientists, and philosophers O&#x2019;Siadhail features lived complex lives, often full of contradictions. Others, though deeply rooted in their context, transcended their time and place and pointed beyond themselves&#x2015;even to us and to a time after modernity&#x2019;s reign.</p><p>The ancient Horace commended literature that delivered "profit with delight." In <i>The Five Quintets</i>, Micheal O&#x2019;Siadhail has done just that: he delights us in the present with his artistry, even as he reveals hidden treasures of our past and compels us toward the future.</p></p><p><p>Micheal O&#x2019;Siadhail is an internationally acclaimed poet whose works include <i>Collected Poems</i> and <i>One Crimson Thread</i>. He is Distinguished Poet in Residence at Union Theological Seminary.</p><p>By any standards this is a big book. Poetry on steroids.

It&#x2019;s an intellectual, cultural and political history of the modern western world. It&#x2019;s a portrait gallery with over a hundred sharply etched miniatures -- Cervantes, Donne and Rubens all the way to Kierkegaard, Levinas and Ricoeur; and these are talking portraits, since the poet not only describes them and addresses them but lets them answer him back.

He fought against rampant development and the depredations of a corporate world that seemed hell-bent on ignoring a looming climate crisis in its relentless pursuit of profit. But as the environmental movement began to focus on &#39;sustainability&#39; rather than the defence of wild places for their own sake and as global conditions worsened, he grew disenchanted with the movement that he once embraced. He gave up what he saw as the false hope that residents of the First World would ever make the kind of sacrifices that might avert the severe consequences of climate change. Full of grief and fury as well as passionate, lyrical evocations of nature and the wild, Confessions of a Recovering Environmentalist gathers the wave-making essays that have charted the change in Kingsnorth&#39;s thinking. In them he articulates a new vision that he calls &#39;dark ecology,&#39; which stands firmly in opposition to the belief that technology can save us, and he argues for a renewed balance between the human and nonhuman worlds. Provocative and urgent, iconoclastic and fearless, this ultimately hopeful book poses hard questions about how we have lived and should live.</p><p>Paul Kingsnorth&#39;s debut novel, The Wake, won the 2014 Gordon Burn Prize and was longlisted for the Booker Prize. His second, Beast, was described by Jay Griffiths as &#39;a portrait of the psyche in gaunt, glittering transcendence.&#39; He is also the author of One No, Many Yeses and Real England, and a poetry collection, Kidland.

Now, like a refreshing spring breeze, Samael Aun Weor wipes away the dust and reveals the sacred mysteries of our most ancient and holy science. With a firm foundation in scripture and practical knowledge, the method to awaken and develop the root energy of life is made clear and accessible to all. It is no longer necessary to theorize or debate: through the practice of the techniques in this book, one can know.</p><p>Thelema Press is a non-profit incorporation delivering to humanity the Gnostic Works of Samael Aun Weor.Many books have been written about Oriental Yoga. Yoga means &#34;union with God.&#34; All the books that were written about Oriental Yoga before the New Era of Aquarius which began the 4th day of February, 1962 between the hours of two and three in the afternoon are antiquated. This book entitled Kundalini Yoga is for the New Aquarian Era. Through this book we teach our disciples a practical religion. All religions teach us unbreakable dogmas on which we have to inevitably believe, even when their truths cannot be seen with eyes of the flesh. In regard to the former statement, we, the Gnostics, are a little different. We teach the human being to see, hear, touch and perceive all of the things from beyond the grave, the divine mysteries, the ineffable things, etc. We sustain that the human being has a sixth sense and that through this sixth sense, he can see the Angels and converse with them. We asseverate that the human being has a seventh sense called &#34;intuition.&#34; The human being can know the great mysteries of life and death when he awakens that seventh sense. He does not need to study these mysteries in any book. So, beloved reader, this book is for that purpose. You will find terrific secrets within this book, secrets that never in the history of life were published. We respect all religions profoundly, and we do not only respect them, but moreover, we teach our disciples how to see, hear, touch and perceive the essential truths that all religions teach in their sacred books. Therefore, this book that you have in your hands is a book of terrific secrets that have never been published. You can develop your occult powers to see, hear, touch and perceive the Angels, Archangels, Seraphim, Potentates, Virtues, etc. You can attain union with God with this book. The Holy Bible has great Truths; thus, we read within the Bible how the prophets of God had the power to talk with the Angels. This book that you have in your hands belongs to the Gnostic Christian Universal Church; read it, study it and meditate on it. This is the Yoga of the New Era of Aquarius.</p><h2>A Carnivore&#39;s Inquiry: A Novel</h2><p>Sabina Murray's first book since she won the PEN/Faulkner Award for The Caprices seduces with its dark delight in her taboo subject.<br>When we meet Katherine, the winning-and rather disturbing-twenty-three-year-old narrator, she has just left Italy and arrived in New York City, but what has propelled her there is a mystery. She soon strikes up an affair with a middle-aged Russian �migr� novelist she meets on the subway, and almost immediately moves into his apartment. Katherine's occasional allusions to a frighteningly eccentric mother and tyrannical father suggest a somberness at the center of her otherwise flippant and sardonic demeanor. Soon restless, she begins journeying across the continent, trailed, everywhere she goes, by a string of murders. As the ritualistic killings begin to pile up, Katherine takes to meditating on cannibalism in literature, art, and history. The story races toward a hair-raising conclusion, while Katherine and the reader close in on the reasons for both her and her mother's fascination with aberrant, violent behavior.<br>A brilliantly subtle commentary on twenty-first-century consumerism and Western culture's obsession with new frontiers, A Carnivore's Inquiry is an unsettling exploration of the questionable appetites that lurk beneath the veneer of civilization.</p><p>Sabina Murray is a member of the MFA faculty at the University of Massachusetts.As provocative as the title may be, the novel is more so. Katherine seems bored even though her place in the world is precarious; she seems composed even though episodes would prove otherwise. As she makes her way across North America, so does a chain of bizarre murders that cut a frightening swath of carnage. Punctuated by almost clinical accounts of cannibalistic moments in history, this chilling story can veer sharply between being intriguing and leaving one cold. Wendy Hoopes captures the removed, almost otherworldly, quality of the novel's storyteller, whose carnivorous interests take a sinister turn.

He helped shape Catholic theology between the two world wars and after, as well as the thinking of many non-Catholics of the period. His influence contributed to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and it continues to be felt through Pope Benedict, who, as a theologian, a cardinal and now as Pope, has drawn extensively on Guardini for inspiration. Indeed, Guardini was a major theological mentor of Benedict XVI, influencing the Pope from his understanding of Jesus to his writings on the sacred Liturgy, from his view of faith to his perspective on the modern world.<p><i>Romano Guardini: Reform from the Source,</i>&nbsp;written by another great theological mind, Hans urs von Balthasar, presents a kind of "roadmap" to Guardini's thought. As an introduction to Guardini, von Balthasar's study is intended to challenge readers to take up Guardini's own writings and to find in him the wisdom that has inspired so many others. Many of Guardini's influential works are still in print today, works that cover a wide range of important spiritual, theological and moral issues.</p></p><p><p><b>Hans Urs von Balthasar&nbsp;</b>(1905&#x2013;1988) was a Swiss theologian widely regarded as one of the greatest theologians and spiritual writers of modern times. Named a cardinal by Pope John Paul II, he died shortly before being formally inducted into the College of Cardinals. He wrote over one hundred books, including&nbsp;<i>Prayer</i>,&nbsp;<i>Heart of the World</i>,&nbsp;<i>Mary for Today</i>,&nbsp;<i>Love Alone Is Credible</i>,&nbsp;<i>Mysterium Paschale&nbsp;</i>and his major multi-volume theological works:&nbsp;<i>The Glory</i>&nbsp;<i>of the Lord</i>,&nbsp;<i>Theo-Drama&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Theo-Logic</i>.</p>Romano Guardini was one of the most important interpreters of the modern Catholic experience, someone we need to engage again and again.

It was a photograph he conceived for himself, without an editorial assignment. It is the incomparable "Girls in the Windows" of 1960.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>Girls in the Windows: And Other Stories</i></b> is the first book to survey the work of Ormond Gigli and escorts the viewer behind the fa�ade of that incredible photograph&#x2014;to understand its genesis and to celebrate its remarkable achievement&#x2014;in addition to creating a portal into the rest of Gigli's brilliant career. This beautifully illustrated volume showcases Gigli's celebrity and fashion photographs, and includes his innovative work in the worlds of theater, film, and dance, as well as his little-known travel photography and photojournalism. Gigli, a master of photo art direction, orchestrated his photo shoots like an accomplished film director, and his portraits are intimate and revealing as a result, his set work inventive and at times even playful. His engagement with his subjects was unparalleled, among whom are included Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, Anna Moffo, Anita Ekberg, Marcel Duchamp, Willem de Kooning, John F. Kennedy, Halston, Marlene Dietrich, Leslie Caron, Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, Barbra Streisand, Laurence Olivier, Alan Bates, Richard Burton, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and many more.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many of these images have not been widely seen since they were first published decades ago. In addition to the photographs, Gigli contributes his personal account of the making of many of the pictures, evoking long-ago encounters that resulted in such timeless images. This handsome volume highlights a significant body of work, captures a vital aspect of the great age of photojournalism, and places in context an iconic image of the postwar era at the height of its prosperity and on the verge of transformation.</p><p><b>Ormond Gigli</b> was born in New York City in 1925.

From its origins, the State has never been anything other than a tool to accumulate power. This inno�vative and partisan study of human social complexity cuts through in�adequate theories of early state formation to uncover social practices and institutions that have stifled egalitarian forms of self-organization throughout history. Just as importantly, it shows that the difficulties and consequences of state formation are not relegated to prehistory. Despite a ubiquity that renders them almost invisible today, states are constantly trying to augment their power, and all are closer to the brink of collapse than they would like to let on.<br><br><b>Peter Gelderloos</b> is an anarchist writer originally from Virginia.

Recording and predicting contemporary style trends, Antonio also used his immense versatility to adopt a broad range of art movements, from Pop Art to Surrealism.<br><br> The man himself, his life and friendships, particularly with Juan Ramos, his constant collaborator, define his oeuvre. For Antonio, life&#x2015;bestial and sublime&#x2015;surpassed any fiction. His illustrations and photographs capture the beautiful people who are part of celebrity folklore, and who were more often than not his friends: Jerry Hall (to whom he was engaged), Grace Jones, Mick Jagger, Audrey Hepburn, Andy Warhol (with whom he worked on <em>Interview</em> magazine), Paloma Picasso and Marlene Dietrich.<br><br> Packed with previously unpublished material, this is a thrilling retrospective about an artist who is represented in major collections from the Metropolitan to the Louvre.

Why had the likeable Deene family seemingly been so in thrall to the late Harriet? The innocent in this classic murder mystery have every reason to be grateful for Inspector Collier of Scotland Yard&#x2019;s involvement, given the incompetent behavior of the local Chief Constable.&nbsp;But as Collier&#x2019;s investigation deepens, the case gets stranger still.

The author wrote two well-received early novels, Olive in Italy (1909), and The Sword of Love (1920). However, her career in crime fiction did not begin until 1924, after which Moray Dalton published twenty-nine mysteries, the last in 1951. The majority of these feature her recurring sleuths, Scotland Yard inspector Hugh Collier and private inquiry agent Hermann Glide. Moray Dalton married Louis Jean Renoir in 1921, and the couple had a son a year later. The author lived on the south coast of England for the majority of her life following the marriage.

His prose is as characteristically sharp as his outlook in the latest Jack Taylor novel, <i>In the Galway Silence</i>.<p> <br><br> After much tragedy and violence, Jack Taylor has at long last landed at contentment. Of course, he still knocks back too much Jameson and dabbles in uppers, but he has a new woman in his life, a freshly bought apartment, and little sign of trouble on the horizon. Once again, trouble comes to him, this time in the form of a wealthy Frenchman who wants Jack to investigate the double-murder of his twin sons. Jack is meanwhile roped into looking after his girlfriend&#x2019;s nine-year-old son, and is in for a shock with the appearance of a character out of his past. The plot is one big chess game and all of the pieces seem to be moving at the behest of one dangerously mysterious player: a vigilante called &#x201c;Silence,&#x201d; because he&#x2019;s the last thing his victims will ever hear.</p><p> <br><br> This is Ken Bruen at his most darkly humorous, his most lovably bleak, as he shows us the meaning behind a proverb of his own design&#x2015;&#x201c;the Irish can abide almost anything save silence.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Ken Bruen</b> received a doctorate in metaphysics, taught English in South Africa, and then became a crime novelist.

This reconstruction of Jackson&#39;s classic work, long out of print, presents 160 photographs and early drawings, paintings, and lithographs by America&#39;s best-known landscape photographer, drawing on Jackson&#39;s diaries, other published accounts, and his annotations of The Pioneer Photographer to create a complete and multidimensional view of the unfolding nineteenth-century American West. Editor Bob Blair has significantly expanded Jackson&#39;s original autobiography, reprinted here in full with the author&#39;s annotations, with seventy additional photographs, drawings, and paintings, and extensive excerpts from Jackson&#39;s writings, much of the new material drawn from archives and historical collections and never before published.</p><p><p><strong>Bob Blair</strong>, an elementary teacher and amateur photographer residing in Taos, New Mexico, first became intrigued with the life and work of William Henry Jackson after obtaining a first edition copy of <em>The Pioneer Photographer</em>. Two decades of research have led to the rediscovery and reissue of this important but forgotten autobiography.</p>Famed for photographs that led to the establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, William Henry Jackson had an as-told-to memoir published in 1929, which provides this volume's foundation. But this is virtually a new book because it collects 136 black-and-white and 24 color images and reconciles Jackson's recollections with ancillary information about the Ferdinand Hayden geological surveys of the 1870s. An easterner, Jackson began his memoir with a description of his sound reasons for going west: a broken engagement and the lack of an occupation. After adventures in a wagon train in the waning years of the Oregon Trail, he established himself as a photographer in Omaha, where Hayden recruited him. Jackson matter-of-factly recalled the incidents of each expedition, many of which involved contretemps with Old Mag, the mule packing his cumbersome wet-plate equipment. In step with the text, the images of landscapes, companions, and Indians render the vibrancy of traveling with Jackson, if only vicariously, and make this handsome restoration a must for the Old West collection. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It undertakes this incredible journey of nearly 3,000 miles twice a year without stopping once to rest or feed. Amazingly, young kolea, left far behind on the Alaskan coast, find their way to Hawaii without any help from their parents. Those of us who witness the comings and goings of these amazing birds often wonder how they travel across thousands of miles of trackless ocean without losing their way.

Since it was 12:07 A.M. and I was standing over a dead body, I had to agree. </p><p>The victim, William H. Steele, a thirty-six-year-old Caucasian male, six feet four, approximately two hundred and thirty pounds, brown hair, brown eyes, lay naked across a bed of crisp winter leaves. Moonlight spilled in every direction, and withered foliage mockingly framed his muscular physique. He bore no open wounds, no bruises. In fact, not a single blemish marred the perfection of his skin. He was only recently dead; heat still radiated from him and curled into the icy night sky. </p><p>Alien Investigation and Removal agents, also known as A.I.R., were scouring the area, meticulously searching between every blade of brittle grass, every grain of dirt. The faint murmurs of their chatter echoed in my ears. I tuned them out and intensified my focus on the body. The man's legs were slightly spread and bent at the knees. One of his hands rested behind his head, and the other was bound to his penis with a -- what the hell was that? I crouched down. Eyes narrowed, I reached out with a gloved hand and slid one finger under the material. A pale blue ribbon, tied in a perfect bow.</p><p>I scowled. Was he supposed to be a gift? </p><p>Yes. Yes, that's exactly what he was, I realized, my scowl deepening. Frost gleamed in his hair like diamonds against dark velvet, yet he hadn't been outside long enough to acquire the frost from nature. He was a gift that had been posed to look carnal, seductive. Alluring. To the average citizen, he would have appeared eager for a long night of sexual gratification. </p><p>To me, he just looked like the corpse that he was. </p><p>His eyes were fixed straight ahead, his lips slightly blue, and he wasn't shivering from the cold. A dead giveaway, if you will. Besides that, his testicles were as smooth and shiny as marble, not shriveled like I supposed every other man's out here were.</p><p>With a wry shake of my head, I pushed to my feet. </p><p>Perhaps my assessment was callous and indifferent; perhaps my humor was misplaced. Dead bodies were the norm in my line of work, and I couldn't allow myself to view this man as an actual person. If I did, I'd have to acknowledge that he once had hopes and dreams, thoughts and feelings. I'd cry for the family he left behind, wonder about the life that had once pulsed through his veins. </p><p>I couldn't do that and still hope to function. With tears came distraction, and with distraction came death. My first year of fieldwork, I had spent more time crying for victims than hunting for their killers, and I had almost become a victim myself. I glanced down at my wrist. The inky blackness of my glove didn't quite meet the cuff of my jacket, leaving a small patch of skin visible. That skin boasted a tattoo of the Grim Reaper's scythe and was just one of my many reminders to remain unemotional. </p><p>I'd gotten the tattoo after recovering from a nasty beating, courtesy of a pissed-off other-worlder. While I'd been lost in my grief for a victim I couldn't even remember now, an energy-absorbing Rycan attacked me from behind -- and kicked major huntress ass. </p><p>I had vowed never to cry again. And I hadn't. Tears were a weakness only civilians could afford.</p><p>I am an alien huntress. I am part of the A.I.R. team, working with or against the New Chicago PD -- whichever suits me at the time. Every night I stalk and kill other-worlders, and whether I'm investigating a death or causing one myself, I have to shove sentiment aside, find humor where I can, and concentrate on the facts. </p><p>I love my job despite the blood and gore -- or maybe because of it. I love solving puzzles, fitting each piece of evidence together. I love that one by one, I'm ridding Earth of our unwanted visitors. </p><p>Yes, some aliens are peaceful and are allowed to live and work among us. Those, I leave alone. But the others? The rapists, the thieves, the killers? I despise them.</p><p>Alien sympathizers often ask me if I, a hunter, a legalized killer, live with guilt. My answer: Hell, no. Why should I feel guilty for destroying a predator? I'm proud of my work. I'm privileged to do what I do. Other-worlders who survive on human carnage deserve the sting of my pyre-gun.</p><p>A glacial blast of wind whirled past my shoulders, scattering a thin sheen of snow powder in every direction. The hem of my long black leather jacket danced around my calves. Four inches of snow had been predicted, so I needed to work quickly. Twenty minutes ago, I'd received a call from my boss, Commander Jack Pagosa. He'd briefed me on the situation. He'd also informed me I had until morning to present him with a suspect, or I would spend the next year behind a desk. </p><p>William Steele, a happily married father of one, had been abducted from his home four weeks prior. His wife and newborn child slept peacefully throughout the entire ordeal, unharmed and unaware. Abductor's point of entry: undetermined. </p><p>Four other dark-haired, dark-eyed men disappeared soon afterward. One had been taken from his workplace, and two had been snatched straight from a crowded street during their lunch hour. Oddly enough, there had been no witnesses and not a single shred of evidence left behind at any scene. Because of the enigmatic nature of each disappearance, aliens were the prime suspect. </p><p>Just half an hour earlier, a hunter on patrol had found Steele in this deserted Southern District field. Thankfully, the hunter had preserved the scene until my team arrived. The first thing I'd noticed was that Steele's body showed no indication of torture, no sign of having been restrained. </p><p>Second, I'd realized his death had nothing to do with impulse or rage -- just as I knew the murder had nothing to do with stupidity or amusement. The scene was too precise, too perfectly planned. Mr. Steele had been killed for a reason. </p><p>What? I couldn't yet fathom.</p><p>I drew in a deep breath -- and stilled. Slowly, I drew in three more breaths. As I exhaled the last, I smiled. Since the first kidnapping, no one had dared guess which of the forty-eight alien species were responsible, but I had just narrowed it down to three. </p><p>The victim had been killed by poison. Onadyn, to be exact. A deoxygenating drug used by the Zi Karas, Arcadians, and Mecs for survival on this planet. They couldn't breathe our air without it. To oxygen-breathers, the substance was lethal. Worse, it was virtually undetectable. Virtually, but not completely. A rare few could identify Onadyn by its scent, a subtle fragrance similar to a dewy breeze during a summer storm. </p><p>I was one of the rare few, and I smelled it now. The scent filled my nostrils, intoxicating and sweet, as lovely as it was deadly, and somehow suddenly more obvious to me than the scent of waste, rotting food, and charred leaves that made up so much of this domain. My observation wasn't as solid as a neon sign blinking over the killer's head that read i did it in bold red letters, but it did point us in the right direction. </p><p>Still, I wanted more.</p><p>I scanned the area to my right, paused, then scanned the area to my left. Except for the occasional twinkle from regulation halolights, the task force blended into the night. </p><p>I dragged my focus farther back, taking in the tall oaks that knifed the sky. The trees were sparsely scattered, their branches naked, their bark weighed down by dripping ice. Situated between the trees were homes and businesses. I use the term <i>businesses</i> loosely, of course. Nice people referred to this seedy, neglected district as Whore's Corner. I'd once been fined for publicly saying what <i>I</i> called the place. </p><p>Had any of the residents seen anything unusual? Would they tell us if they had?</p><p>I'd already dispatched the most charming of my agents to question every citizen within a one-mile radius. But this late at night, civilians tended to be cranky and distrustful. Besides that, the Southern District was notorious for its hatred of law enforcement -- human or otherwise. </p><p>"What do you think, Mia?" Dallas Gutierrez, my right-hand man, strode to my side. He wore a black leather jacket and black combat boots that fit the hard planes of his body to perfection. At times, I thought he was too handsome to be real. His hair was dark and thick, and the inky locks hung in sexy disarray over the wide, muscled length of his shoulders. Perfect eyebrows arched over perfectly shaped eyes. Perfect cheekbones framed a perfect nose. </p><p>For some reason, he was smiling -- revealing perfect white teeth, the bastard -- yet even as the brown depths of his eyes glinted with mischief, he still possessed the razor-sharp edge of a hunter. </p><p>I admired him for that. </p><p>On more than one occasion, Dallas Gutierrez had flipped Death the bird and come out alive. He was a man who rushed into the middle of danger without hesitation. He considered his friends' safety before he considered his own, and he never regretted his choice, even when he lay wounded and bleeding. He'd saved my life so many times, I should have tattooed his name on my ass. </p><p>"What do you think?" he repeated. "Which group of aliens is responsible?" </p><p>"Zi Karas, Arcadians, or Mecs."</p><p>A little of the sparkle left his eyes. "You sure?"</p><p>I tossed him an are-you-kidding-me frown. "Can a woman lose one hundred and seventy-five pounds of unwanted fat by divorcing her husband?"</p><p>"Damn." He chuckled, the sound rich and husky in the twilight. "No wonder you're still single. You're vicious." </p><p>Damn right I was. I had to be. I was a woman in a man's profession, and just because I carried a pyre-gun did not mean I was taken seriously. Not even Dallas had taken me seriously at first.</p><p>His first week on the job, he fought to have me relocated. "Women aren't hunters," he'd said so many times I wanted to brand the words on his chest -- while he was awake and tied to his bed. </p><p>I stand at five feet five, weigh one hundred and twenty pounds. I'm only twenty-eight years old, but I have an indomitable will. I do not take shit from anyone, especially when it comes to my job. The first time Dallas and I practiced hand-to-hand combat, I had him on the groun...</p></p><h2>Your Yin Yang Body Type: The Korean Tradition of Sasang Medicine</h2><p>Optimize your health by learning the inherent strengths and weaknesses of your body type <br> <br>� Explains the 4 major body types of Korean Sasang medicine; the best foods, exercises, and herbs for each; and what to avoid <br> <br>� Reveals how the Yin Yang energy balance of the bodily organs relates to the emotional balance and health of each body type <br> <br>� Provides 2 different self-tests to determine your type <br> <br>Deeply rooted in the classics of Oriental medicine, the ancient Korean art of Sasang medicine explains how we each are born with a specific body &#x201c;type&#x201d; that establishes our physical and emotional strengths and weaknesses. These traits have a direct influence on how we interact with others and react to stress, trauma, and illness. Discovering your type can empower you to make the best choices regarding your health and well-being. <br> <br>In this book, Dr. Gary Wagman explores the 4 major body types of Sasang medicine and 2 different self-tests to determine your type. He explains the balance of Yin and Yang energy within the organs for each type and how this underlies your emotional tendencies and health patterns. With a strong spleen and weaker kidneys, for example, the Yang type A person will be inclined to anger and susceptible to urinary complaints. Offering stories from his Sasang medical practice, as well as his own healing, the author shows how organ excesses and deficiencies are often the culprit in emotional and psychological issues and how addressing these energetic imbalances can bring about lasting change. <br> <br>Dr. Wagman provides an extensive look at the most beneficial foods for each type and those that could be harmful, as well as which forms of exercise are most effective. He shows which herbs are most compatible for you and which could exacerbate your inborn energetic imbalances. He offers Sasang approaches for a range of common conditions, from high blood pressure, aching joints, and allergies to common colds, inadequate sleep, and weight gain. He also introduces ways to enhance spiritual well-being by balancing your innate emotional strengths and weaknesses. Addressing the body, mind, and spirit, discovering your Yin Yang body type provides the key to optimizing physical, emotional, and spiritual health.</p><p>Gary Wagman, Ph.D., L.Ac., is an acupuncturist and doctor of Oriental Medicine.

Or why someone could blithely chain-smoke into their nineties? Simply thinking these people are just healthier than you and I would not suffice. Excessive alcohol drinking eventually leads to cirrhosis of the liver, while chain-smoking is a sure path to emphysema. To avoid these conditions while excessively smoking or drinking throughout one&#x2019;s life may seem almost superhuman! According to Sasang Medicine, each and every person is born with a strongest and weakest organ depending on their body type. The health of someone who is born with weaker lungs will usually be compromised even after the first cigarette. The person born with a weaker liver often becomes ill even after his or her first experience with alcohol. Yet smoking and drinking may have no effect on the health of those whose strongest organs are the lungs or liver.<br><b><br>WHAT IS SASANG MEDICINE?</b><br><br>The Sasang medical system is based on the theory that each individual is born with varying emotional and physical strengths and weaknesses depending on his or her body type. These tendencies have a direct influence on how our minds and bodies react to stress and illness.<br><br>The Korean word <i>sasang</i> means &#x201c;four types.&#x201d; It signifies the classification of all people into four major body types--Yin A, Yin B, Yang A, and Yang B. This medical system was first established by the Korean doctor Lee Jae Ma (1837-1900), who was well versed in the Oriental medical tradition, a system that focuses on the balance of Yin and Yang energy to treat emotional and physical illnesses. Dr. Ma was distraught by the fact that some patients who suffered from the same symptoms improved quickly, while others suffered longer despite adequate treatment. The development of Sasang Medicine was based on Dr. Ma&#x2019;s ability to focus treatment on the individual rather than the disease, emphasizing the unique constitutional structure of each patient.<br><br><i>Your Yin Yang Body Type</i> is a book that helps familiarize you with your body type&#x2019;s physical and emotional inclinations. It can serve as a compass to help you navigate the way toward optimum health through the ability to<br><br>� recognize your innate strengths and weaknesses<br>� make wiser choices about which foods to eat for your health<br>� understand which forms of exercise complement your body type<br>� choose the right supplements and herbs for your constitution<br>� avoid emotional traps and strengthen your inner self<br><b><br>THE YIN YANG BODY TYPE TEST</b><br><br>This test is one of several ways to determine your body type based on emotional, psychological, and physical tendencies. While some of our tendencies are easy to detect, others may be unapparent. Take advantage of assistance from friends and family to answer the 41 questions. Often others are able to shed light on aspects of our personality that we may have overlooked. Tally your total score for each question group (A-D) and refer to the Body Type Key at the end to determine your body type. The accompanying answer key explains the significance of how each question relates to each body type. While taking the body type test keep the following tips in mind:<br><br><b>Tip #1:</b> Focus on overall tendencies--certain tendencies may change from day to day or throughout the years. It is sometimes helpful to reflect on how things used to be as a child since our body type never changes.<br><br><b>Tip #2:</b> Some questions may require examining your physical body closely. You may have to take a good look in the mirror or observe how you walk to answer certain questions.<br><br><b>Tip #3:</b> Do not answer a question if, no matter how much you try, an answer does not come to mind. It is better to leave it blank than to obscure test results.<br><br><b>Tip #4:</b> If you are not sure how to answer a particular question, refer to the answer key provided after the test. It offers an in depth explanation of each question, making it easier to answer.<br><br><b>Tip #5:</b> If you are still unsure how to answer a particular question or what body type you are, continue onward to the Body Shape section. Your body shape may be adequate in determining your type.<br><br><b>Tip #6:</b> Did you score a tie between two body types? Is the difference between two types slight? If so, try the test again, maybe with the help of someone who knows you well. If the difference between two body types remains slight, go with the highest score.</p><h2>How to Resist: Turn Protest to Power</h2><p><p><b>"This extraordinary book is the roadmap for a new kind of effective activism."' -- Brian Eno</b></p><p>"This book is for people who are angry with the ways things are and want to do something about it; for people who are frustrated with the system, or worried about the direction the country is going.

In some ways he never left. After a decade of visiting regularly, he settled near <i>Coj�mar</i>&#x2014;a tiny fishing village east of Havana&#x2014;and came to think of himself as Cuban. His daily life among the common people there taught him surprising lessons, and inspired the novel that would rescue his declining career. That book, <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>, won him a Pulitzer and, one year later, a Nobel Prize. In a rare gesture of humility, Hemingway announced to the press that he accepted the coveted Nobel &#x201c;as a citizen of <i>Coj�mar</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>In <i>Ernesto</i>, Andrew Feldman uses his unprecedented access to newly available archives to tell the full story of Hemingway&#x2019;s self-professed Cuban-ness: his respect for <i>Coj�mar</i> fishermen, his long-running affair with a Cuban lover, the warmth of his adoptive Cuban family, the strong influences on his work by Cuban writers, his connections to Cuban political figures and celebrities, his denunciation of American imperial ambitions, and his enthusiastic role in the revolution. <br><br>With a focus on the island&#x2019;s violent political upheavals and tensions that pulled Hemingway between his birthplace and his adopted country, Feldman offers a new angle on our most influential literary figure. Far from being a post-success, pre-suicide exile, Hemingway&#x2019;s decades in Cuba were the richest and most dramatic of his life, and a surprising instance in which the famous American bully sought redemption through his loyalty to the underdog.</p><p><b>Andrew Feldman</b>&nbsp;spent two years conducting research in residence at the Hemingway Museum and Library in Havana, Cuba. He has taught at Tulane University, Dillard University, and the University of Maryland. He lives with his wife in New Orleans, Louisiana.Along the windswept banks of a fishing village a few miles from Havana there is a bust dedicated to the memory of a writer, set there by its inhabitants, the fishermen of Coj�mar. When they first heard the news that Hemingway was dead, it felt as if they had received a blow from the long beam of their sail as wind changed and the boat came suddenly about. Still, some of them doubted the validity of the news; after all, the papers had declared his death on more than one occasion and were obliged to retract their stories when Mr. Way (as many of the fishermen, finding his full name difficult to pronounce, called him) returned from the dead, indestructible and immortal, like some hero of ancient lore. Others, sneering at the headlines, rejected the suggestion, repeating itself like a vulgar joke in the newspapers and on the radio, that his death had been a suicide. In this way, they were able for a time to maintain the fiction that their friend, Ernest Hemingway, was alive and that he had never faltered in the face of death. <br><br>For thirty years, the villagers had shared the sea and fished with Hemingway, so they believed that they knew him well. They came to love him naturally and simply, like a brother, as was their custom, and he came to love them back. Whenever he, in his motored craft, encountered them after a long day of fishing, rowing back beneath the sun, el americano would throw out a line and tow their boats back to port. Often, he would invite them for a drink in La Terraza, the village restaurant-bar beside the docks where they could talk, exchange tips about sea conditions, and enjoy some rum and one another&#x2019;s company. Asking many questions, Ernest Hemingway, the writer, listened intently to their responses, to their sentiments, and to their manner of speaking&#x2014;slowly gathering details for his work and strengthening ties of friendship with these men. <br><br>In Coj�mar where his first mate Gregorio Fuentes also lived, Hemingway kept his boat, the <i>Pilar.</i> It was safe there. Everyone in the village knew who owned it, and they looked after it as if it were their own. As the years passed, he had become part of their community; when Gregorio Fuentes&#x2019;s daughters married, Hemingway, along with the other fishermen, attended their weddings. <br><br>Hemingway&#x2019;s experiences in Coj�mar provided the material that allowed him to write the novel that rescued his career and restored his readers&#x2019; faith in his astonishing talent. His previous novel, <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>, had been considered a failure. This awkward work of &#x201c;fiction&#x201d; indulgently explored two of his infatuations: his World War I wounds and nineteen-year-old Venetian beauty Adriana Ivancich, with whom he had become enamored while deep in the throes of a middle-age crisis. The book was ill received by both the public and his critics, who ridiculed its self-indulgent style, gossiped about the disgraceful goings-on of its aging author, and declared his career over. Like a counterpunch, Hemingway then released a much shorter work, over a decade in the making, condensing his experiences accumulated during a lifetime of fishing the Gulf Stream&#x2014;with the fishermen he had come to admire. He called this novella, about an aging fisherman and his Cuban village of Coj�mar, <i>The Old Man and the Sea. <br></i> <br>The work achieved immediate success and widespread praise from many of the very critics who had so roughly criticized his previous work. It won him a Pulitzer Prize and, one year later, resulted in the achievement of literature&#x2019;s highest honor, the Nobel Prize&#x2014;solidifying his place as a literary legend. Recognizing his debt to the village&nbsp;and to Cuba, Hemingway immediately announced to the press that he had won the prize &#x201c;as a citizen of Coj�mar . . . as a <i>Cubano sato</i>.&#x201d; It was a gesture that ran countercurrent to prevailing politics of his day, one that underlined his respect for the Cuban people and affirmed his identity as a world citizen and a member of the Caribbean community in which he lived. Keeping a promise that he had made to himself and to an old friend, he donated his prize medal to the church of La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, the people&#x2019;s patron saint who, Cubans believe, possesses the supernatural power to grant or to withhold great favors. His gift not only underlined his gratitude but also suggested that, after twenty-two years of residence in Cuba, Hemingway believed in <i>La Virgen </i>too. <br><br>In the pages of <i>Life </i>magazine, <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> first appeared with pictures of Hemingway walking along the shores of Coj�mar village on its cover. Warner Brothers offered Hemingway $150,000 for the movie rights and another $75,000 to serve as the film&#x2019;s technical advisor, an unprecedented sum for a writer to receive in 1953. Drawing from the film&#x2019;s $5 million budget, the author also insisted upon employing all of Coj�mar&#x2019;s fishermen to assist in the production, in order to lend the film some authenticity, to recognize them, and to bring their struggling families some much-needed income. <br><br>"Hemingway Dead of Shotgun Wound; Wife Says He Was Cleaning Weapon,&#x201d; said the newspaper, which Coj�mar&#x2019;s fishermen read before wrapping it around the baitfish that they would bring on the boat that day. Reflecting upon it, they saw Mary&#x2019;s denial was merely her grief, and after long hours spent at sea, the realization that they were also grieving floated slowly to the surface. When they returned to port and observed his ship, the <i>Pilar,</i> anchored there, floating without a captain, their throats thickened from the emptiness, for they understood they missed a friend and a man that they had admired. They could not bring themselves to judge this man that they respected and loved. Gathering at La Terraza, they stood silently along the bar where their friend no longer appeared. But they wanted to do something more to honor him. <br><br>They decided to commission a sculpture and place it at the entrance of the harbor of their town. They were very poor, and they did not have enough money to purchase the material, so they melted down the propellers from their boats for a sculptor to fashion into a bust. Today the bust remains, its eyes fixed forever, gazing into the waters of the Gulf, a source of life and mystery that the writer loved and so often wrote about. <br><br>As a Hemingway scholar completing my dissertation at the Universit� de Paris IV, La Sorbonne, and following my research in Spain, I stumbled upon a story of Hemingway&#x2019;s friendship with America&#x2019;s persistent enemy. Then I read an article in a French newspaper announcing that the Finca Vig�a Museum in Havana would be opening its doors and archives to foreign researchers like me. Following Hemingway&#x2019;s example, I wanted to &#x201c;go to the source&#x201d; to investigate. <br><br>What I found there was an untold and remarkable story of Hemingway in Cuba, which has been eclipsed by fifty-seven years of Cold War blockade. The blockade, which continues to this day, has defined Cuban-American relations for the last half century and has had many regrettable consequences: it severed many of our cultural, intellectual, familial, and economic ties, and the prolonged separation has complicated our capacity to understand each other and the history that we &#x201c;Americans&#x201d; inevitably share. As Hemingway&#x2019;s own story shows, the difficult lessons are not received easily, but those lessons are invaluable when attained in struggle against our own wayward natures&#x2014;over time. <br><br>As the first North American permitted to study in residence at the Finca Vig�a Museum and Research Center, I spent two years conducting interviews and examining documents that had previously been unavailable to other researchers. My investigations bore many fruitful discoveries, and when I myself &#x201c;became Cuban,&#x201d; through marriage, I believe that my perspective increased and continues increasing, a little each day, and in ways that I hope will add depth to this narrative. <br><br>Formerly, numerous respected researchers, unable to consult Cuban sources, had concluded that Hemingway lived in Cuba in isolation, as an expatriate American writer who did not associate with the Cuban people; yet my research in that country in consultation with Cuban sources revealed a completely different Hemingway, one who enjoyed a long and enriching friendship with Cuban fishermen like Gregorio Fuentes and Carlos Gutierrez, and with Cuban writers like Enrique Serpa and Fernando G. Campoamor, as well as an enduring affair and tender friendship with Leopoldina Rodr�guez. <br><br>In Cuba, it is often said that Hemingway loved Cuba and that Cuba loved him back, and everywhere one goes in Havana this emotion appears in plaques that pay homage to the author, in statues, in Coj�mar, in Habana Vieja&#x2019;s Floridita Bar, at the Bodeguita del Medio, at the &#x201c;Marina Hemingway,&#x201d; in the affection with which Cubans speak of him, and in the way they maintain his boat, the <i>Pilar,</i> and his Finca Vig�a home&#x2014;as a monument and as a museum&#x2014;as a shrine to the friendship that might have been.</p><h2>Coming to Life: How Genes Drive Development</h2><p><p><strong><strong>Christiane Nusslein-Volhard, winner of The Nobel Prize in Medicine, gives a concise and illustrative overview of genetics, evolution, and cellular processes as well as a discussing of current ethical issues in human biology.</strong></strong></p><em>Coming to Life</em> is a remarkable journey through developmental biology that reveals miraculous processes in the microscopic world of cells.

He revisits the meme, the unit of cultural information that he named and wrote about in his groundbreaking work <i>The Selfish Gene</i>. He makes moving tributes to friends and colleagues, including a eulogy for novelist Douglas Adams; he shares correspondence with the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; and he visits with the famed paleoanthropologists Richard and Maeve Leakey at their African wildlife preserve. He concludes the essays with a vivid note to his ten-year-old daughter, reminding her to remain curious, to ask questions, and to live the examined life.</p></p><p>Richard Dawkins has an opinion on everything biological, it seems, and in <i>A Devil's Chaplain</i>, everything is biological. Dawkins weighs in on topics as diverse as ape rights, jury trials, religion, and education, all examined through the lens of natural selection and evolution. Although many of these essays have been published elsewhere, this book is something of a greatest-hits compilation, reprinting many of Dawkins' most famous recent compositions. They are well worth re-reading. His 1998 review of Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont's <i>Fashionable Nonsense</i> is as bracing an indictment of academic obscurantism as the book it covered, although the review reveals some of Dawkins' personal biases as well. Several essays are devoted to skillfully debunking religion and mysticism, and these are likely to raise the hackles of even casual believers. Science, and more specifically evolutionary science, underlies each essay, giving readers a glimpse into the last several years' debates about the minutiae of natural selection. In one moving piece, Dawkins reflects on his late rival Stephen Jay Gould's <i>magnum opus</i>, <i>The Structure of Evolutionary Theory</i>, and clarifies what it was the two Darwinist heavyweights actually disagreed about. While the collection showcases Dawkins' brilliance and intellectual sparkle, it brings up as many questions as it answers. As an ever-ardent champion of science, honest discourse, and rational debate, Dawkins will obviously relish the challenge of answering them. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>RICHARD DAWKINS taught zoology at the University of California at Berkeley and at Oxford University and is now the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position he has held since 1995. Among his previous books are The Ancestor&#x2019;s Tale, The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the Rainbow, and A Devil&#x2019;s Chaplain. Dawkins lives in Oxford with his wife, the actress and artist Lalla Ward.</p><h2>Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths</h2><p><p><strong>A revisionist account of the most famous trial and execution in Western civilization&#x2015;one with great resonance for American society today.</strong></p> Socrates&#x2019; trial and death together form an iconic moment in Western civilization. In 399 BCE, the great philosopher stood before an Athenian jury on serious charges: impiety and &#x201c;subverting the young men of the city.&#x201d; The picture we have of it&#x2015;created by his immediate followers, Plato and Xenophon, and perpetuated in countless works of literature and art ever since&#x2015;is of a noble man putting his lips to the poisonous cup of hemlock, sentenced to death in a fit of folly by an ancient Athenian democracy already fighting for its own life. But an icon, an image, is not reality, and time has transmuted so many of the facts into historical fable.<br><br> Aware of these myths, Robin Waterfield has examined the actual Greek sources and presents here a new Socrates, in which he separates the legend from the man himself. As Waterfield recounts the story, the charges of impiety and corrupting the youth of Athens were already enough for a death sentence, but the prosecutors accused him of more. They asserted that Socrates was not just an atheist and the guru of a weird sect but also an elitist who surrounded himself with politically undesirable characters and had mentored those responsible for defeat in the Peloponnesian War. Their claims were not without substance, for Plato and Xenophon, among Socrates&#x2019; closest companions, had idolized him as students, while Alcibiades, the hawkish and notoriously self-serving general, had brought Athens to the brink of military disaster. In fact, as Waterfield perceptively shows through an engrossing historical narrative, there was a great deal of truth, from an Athenian perspective, in these charges.<br><br> The trial was, in part, a response to troubled times&#x2015;Athens was reeling from a catastrophic war and undergoing turbulent social changes&#x2015;and Socrates&#x2019; companions were unfortunately direct representatives of these troubles. Their words and actions, judiciously sifted and placed in proper context, not only serve to portray Socrates as a flesh-and-blood historical figure but also provide a good lens through which to explore both the trial and the general history of the period.<br><br> Ultimately, the study of these events and principal figures allows us to finally strip away the veneer that has for so long denied us glimpses of the real Socrates. <em>Why Socrates Died</em> is an illuminating, authoritative account of not only one of the defining periods of Western civilization but also of one of its most defining figures. 4 pages of illustrations</p><p><strong>A revisionist account of the most famous trial and execution in Western civilization&#x2015;one with great resonance for American society today.</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> In the spring of 399 BCE, Socrates stood trial in his native Athens. The court was packed, and after being found guilty by his peers, Socrates died by drinking a cup of the poison hemlock. But, Robin Waterfield asks in this provocative reinterpretation of one of the most famous court cases in world history, is this the whole story? Examining not only the actual records but placing Socrates in the historical context of an Athenian society in a state of moral decline, Waterfield provides a gripping portrait of our most enduring philosopher.<br> &nbsp;<br> Praise for Robin Waterfield&#x2019;s <em>Xenophon&#x2019;s Retreat</em>:<br><br> &#x201c;An excellent book.

Kat rides a motorcycle, shoots target pistol, and has been known to swing dance, sing, and spend insufficient time at the gym.<br>&nbsp;<b>Prologue</b><br><br>I am trying to break my habit of dying. I&#x2019;ve had my turns on the dance floor with death at least three times that I know of. So far, it has never lasted more than a few minutes and I hope I won&#x2019;t be staying longer anytime soon. Although I fear my next pas de deux with the Reaper will be the last and lasting one, I prefer to put that bow off as long as possible.<br><br>Each time I&#x2019;ve died, I&#x2019;ve awakened changed in ways normal people can&#x2019;t see. These unexpected and unwanted adjustments have stuck me with a strange job: to protect the Grey, the fringe between the normal world and the world of the purely paranormal, from which rises the ghosts and monsters of our collective nightmares, where magic sings across the blackness of this world between worlds as clouds and lines of gleaming energy. Sometimes I must also protect the rest of the world from the Grey and things that are birthed there. I am not a magical creature myself&#x2014;at least not in the way a ghost or a vampire, a witch or a sorcerer, is. I&#x2019;m just the leg man and general dogsbody for the thing that guards the place; I&#x2019;m a Greywalker&#x2014;Hands of the Guardian, Paladin of the Dead.<br><br>None of these titles are on my business cards or my office door. As far as the normal world of Seattle is concerned, I&#x2019;m Harper Blaine, private investigator. It&#x2019;s the job I was doing long before an angry man killed me and helped introduce me to the Grey. I continue to do it partly because I&#x2019;m good at it and largely because ghosts tend to stiff me on the bill. Some days I long for the boredom of background checks, personal&#x2013;injury fraud, and missing persons handed off from an overworked police department. But something always seems to lead me back to the Grey, whether I want it to or not. My friends and family&#x2014;such as they are&#x2014;get the short, hard end of the stick too much of the time. I am sorry for that and I know I owe them something better. When the living nightmares are bleakest and thick around me, these ties are all that keep me anchored to what is good and right and human, and I will hold those things close, because this is not a job you quit&#x2014;it&#x2019;s one you die from.<br><br><b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>The news called it a ghost ship. I didn&#x2019;t detect any ghosts from the outside, but the boat was enshrouded in thick, colored skeins of Grey fog and ghostlight in gleaming, watery shades: aqua and cerulean with thin whispers of violet twining through them all. I didn&#x2019;t see any ghosts per se, but there was definitely something paranormal going on&#x2014;more than any reporter was likely to credit.<br><br>I stood in the fog near the end of B dock, waiting, looking at the <i>Seawitch</i>. The insurance paperwork called the old wooden boat a fantail motor yacht, designed by someone named Ted Geary&#x2014;which I guessed was a big deal. I&#x2019;ve dealt with boats before, but I&#x2019;m certainly not an expert and a lot of the technical information about this boat meant nothing to me. It had a long, low profile&#x2014;relatively speaking&#x2014;with a round stern and rakish angles that exuded a Jazz Age sense of power. I knew the family had money&#x2014;the boat wasn&#x2019;t the only expensive object the insurance company that had hired me had covered for them&#x2014;but the vessel wasn&#x2019;t flashy; in its current derelict and stained condition, freighted with mystery, it was grim.<br><br>By all reports&#x2014;official and speculative&#x2014;the <i>Seawitch</i> had cruised away from its berth in this same marina twenty&#x2013;seven years earlier and vanished from the knowledge of men, taking four passengers and one crewman with it. They had never returned but the boat had; suddenly and without any sign of hands aboard, it had simply been found one recent morning, standing at the end of its old dock. The derelict boat had been moved to B to rest with the abandoned, broken, seized, and foreclosed vessels until the truth of its reappearance could be ascertained.<br><br>The story in the newspaper claimed that the boat had sailed into port under its own power, but, really, the <i>Seawitch</i> seemed to have arrived under cover of the strange, low&#x2013;hanging morning fog that had swelled around the edges of the Sound and skulked below the bluffs every June morning in Seattle that year, making the hills and spires of the city appear as islands afloat in a haunted sea. Here it was, a lost ship piloted by no one living, returning to its berth after being presumed lost with all hands. Of course, that wasn&#x2019;t quite the truth of the matter but it was close enough. And it raised the hit rate at the news Web sites by a thousand percent, which was far more important than veracity; advertisers pay for eyeballs, not for unvarnished truth.<br><br>The insurance company had paid the claim long ago, and when the <i>Seawitch</i>reappeared, they were far more interested in where the boat had been all this time and why it wasn&#x2019;t a hotel for fish at the bottom of Puget Sound than in unraveling any ghostly sea stories. They felt it far more likely that someone had defrauded them than that the boat and its crew had somehow vanished and remained hidden for all this time. They wanted prosecutable answers.<br><br>The case would have landed back with the original investigator but he&#x2019;d retired, and since freaky circumstances are my specialty it didn&#x2019;t take long for the file to end up on my desk. This case had the smell of something that would taint your life and haunt your dreams for years afterwardm, so I wouldn&#x2019;t have blamed anyone who passed on it, especially since insurance investigations of this kind don&#x2019;t come with high&#x2013;end recovery fees&#x2014;just lowball hourly wages and the occasional dinky bonus. Insurance investigators are sometimes known to play fast and loose, so once the cops got involved, my colleagues were even less interested in contesting my assignment.<br><br>Lucky me. I not only got the case; I knew the cop.<br><br>And so I stood in the shreds of morning mist, waiting for Detective Rey Solis to arrive, show me aboard, and explain why the Seattle Police Department was involved in what should have been a matter for the maritime lawyers and insurance actuaries to scrap over in court. Something large and dark&#x2014;maybe an otter hunting in the salmon run&#x2014;splashed in the water beside the dock and made me jump.<br><br>In the swirling fog, the sound of footsteps on the floating cement dock bounced off the water in a disorienting fashion. I turned my back to the boat and the unseen otter and stood still, waiting for someone to emerge. Solis, looking like a specter in his dark raincoat with his wet dark hair plastered against his head, seemed to resolve from the murk as he drew close enough to see me, and I him. He nodded to me and stopped at the foot of the steps someone had provided for boarding the <i>Seawitch</i>.<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning.&#x201d;<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t so sure of it, but I nodded back. &#x201c;Morning, Solis. How did you get stuck with this one?&#x201d; I knew he&#x2019;d been promoted to detective sergeant not long ago and he probably had the seniority to avoid an assignment like this one. Homicide had been separated from other major crimes a few years back and this sort of thing wasn&#x2019;t their usual beat. They were still top dog where any suspicious or violent death was concerned, but the vagueness of the jurisdiction might have put it in some other agency&#x2019;s bailiwick or given a senior officer an excuse to push it onto someone else.<br><br>He cocked his head in what I thought of as his half shrug, but didn&#x2019;t explain himself. His aura didn&#x2019;t give him away, either, but it rarely does.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t say I was unhappy to be working with Solis&#x2014;he&#x2019;s a good detective and I respect him&#x2014;but I&#x2019;d never thought Solis was comfortable with me or the creepy cases I seemed to attract, so this was going to be interesting, most likely in that Chinese&#x2013;curse sort of way.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I started, not sure what I should say, &#x201c;<i>I&#x2019;m</i> glad it&#x2019;s you. Better than working with someone new.&#x201d;<br><br>He gave another small nod and turned to look at the <i>Seawitch</i>. &#x201c;She does not look like a ghost ship, does she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Looks solid enough,&#x201d; I replied. The structure was intact as far as I could tell. I was more than ready to go aboard and not worried about the physical side of the boat: I couldn&#x2019;t recall ever being seasick except when experiencing the sensation of the world heaving underfoot when I&#x2019;d first been introduced to the Grey. I&#x2019;d gotten over that eventually.<br><br>Solis led the way on board, up a set of plastic stairs that were a little too short&#x2014;the last step to the deck was about eighteen inches above the last riser and a couple of feet away across empty air. With my long legs it was only annoying, but Solis, being five inches shorter than I, had to stretch a bit. He then used a key on the padlock affixed to a makeshift hasp on the main hatch. Someone had taken a drill to the original lock inset in the narrow wooden door and the remains sat loosely in their case, making a metallic rattle as Solis pushed inward.<br><br>&#x201c;Did your guys drill the lock or was it that way when you got here?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;It was one of the Port Authority employees,&#x201d; he replied, stepping inside, since there was no room to move any other direction with me standing on the side deck behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;They can just do that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, if safety is in question.&#x201d;<br><br>The boat didn&#x2019;t seem like a hazard&#x2014;just a bit old and abused&#x2014;but in this day of terrorism, I suppose the thinking was, Who could be sure that it wasn&#x2019;t a bomb or a floating biological attack waiting to happen?<br><br>I nodded as Solis watched me slip through the doorway. I nearly recoiled at the smell inside.<br><br>The room reeked of mildew and wood rot. We&#x2019;d walked into a huge upper salon with scattered sofas and tables around the room and sturdy wooden cabinets and shelves built into the walls below the window line. The cream and blue upholstery on the seats was striped with green and black stains, and the filthy blue carpet felt moist and spongy underfoot. The matching blue curtains had rotted to shreds, and the tables and cabinet doors were warped and discolored. From inside I could see out in almost any direction between the ruined hangings. I would bet the sun shining on all that glass had done its part to advance the rot, and at the same time, the spotted windows made the room seem both open and trapped in its own personal fog bank.<br><br>I sneezed and coughed a little as the smell aggravated my nose and throat. &#x201c;Ugh,&#x201d; I muttered. The movement of the boat was barely noticeable, but the stink was compensating for the lack of <i>mal de mer</i>.<br><br>&#x201c;It is unpleasant,&#x201d; Solis responded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s worse below.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh . . . goody,&#x201d; I replied, turning my attention back to the room around us.<br><br>A squared&#x2013;off arrangement of the furniture defined a lounge area that faced the rear of the living room&#x2013;like space&#x2014;I knew real hard&#x2013;core boat people would have called it the saloon, as it was labeled on the plans, but damned if I would. I wondered why the seats were oriented to the back until I figured out that the entire rear wall was made of wood&#x2013;and&#x2013;glass panels that folded aside to open the back of the space to the round, covered aft deck. Passengers could sit inside reading, chatting, or eating while enjoying the outdoors without having to be in it&#x2014;back when the interior was still clean and dry&#x2014;and if the weather went sour could still use the area just by pulling the doors across. Judging by the moisture level, the weather had invaded at some point, doors or no doors.<br><br>&#x201c;Could we open those up and air this place out a bit?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>Solis considered it, then nodded and went to open up the doors himself, scowling at me when I moved to help. I ignored him. The sooner we had the boat open and full of fresher air, the better, as far as I was concerned. It wasn&#x2019;t as if we were trampling up a clean crime scene here. Whatever had happened aboard the <i>Seawitch</i>, it hadn&#x2019;t taken place recently.<br><br>I touched the nearest of the folding doors and felt a cold frisson race up my arm and across my scalp. I must have gasped or twitched, because Solis cocked his head and glanced at me from the corner of his eye.<br><br>I shook him off. &#x201c;Just one of those creepy feelings.&#x201d;<br><br>He grunted, nodded, and went back to opening doors. Once we had the back of the boat open, fresher, cold air rushed in, swirling around and, to my eyes, raising filaments of violet, blue, and green energy off the floor and furnishings as if the magical residue of whatever had happened in the boat had dried out like sea grass left on the shore. The fine threads were the same colors I&#x2019;d observed outside. I helped Solis shove the last of the resisting, warped doors aside and took a moment to peer harder at the Grey&#x2014;that thin space of magic and possibility lying between the normal and the paranormal worlds.<br><br>The misty material of the Grey was acting stranger than usual here; instead of the foggy, airy movement I normally saw, the boat seemed to be filled with two separate Grey fluids that refused to mix. The brew flowed and crested in the space as if held in an agitated fishbowl, the walls warped and rough around it. At the far end and to the right was a staircase where one of the substances flowed down, taking all the amethyst color with it as well as the cerulean and emerald, while the other remained above, showing only thin watery shades of blue and green. The air felt colder in that area, piercing right through my jacket like winter ice.<br><br>I stared a moment longer at the strange tide of the Grey. It looked . . . as if something powerful had passed through the boat from back to front, sinking down where it found access and leaving this lingering stream as a reminder. How long ago had it been at full flood?<br><br>I turned my attention back to the normal world, to Solis, who was frowning at me nearby.<br><br>&#x201c;This . . . evidence of something foul that brought you here&#x2014;is it downstairs?&#x201d; I asked, thinking about the direction and flow of the energetic traces.<br><br>He raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;Yes. Come with me.&#x201d;<br><br>He continued to frown as he turned to lead me to the scene of whatever crime the SPD suspected had happened aboard. Judging by the way his usually quiet aura spiked and jumped, I&#x2019;d rattled him&#x2014;which was no mean trick.<br><br>We bypassed the rest of the upper deck and I followed him down the narrow staircase&#x2014;a &#x201c;companionway,&#x201d; to sailors&#x2014;submerging into the oily, swirling Grey. For an instant I thought I was drowning, the rising spectral liquid bringing a cold recollection of a certain teenage summer when I&#x2019;d gone swimming with my cousin Jill and not entirely escaped my first brush with death. Jill had not escaped at all. I was glad I was behind Solis and he couldn&#x2019;t see me jerk my head back in suddenly remembered terror as the uncanny fluid seemed to rise over my face and push into my mouth and nose. In a moment the sensation passed as I continued to breathe normally, but my heart was still racing for a while afterward and the scent of the sea stayed in the air around me as long as we remained aboard the <i>Seawitch</i>.<br><br>From the foot of the stairs, Solis lead me forward along a narrow corridor that ran about a third the length of the boat. As we walked I felt colder and colder and the sense of damp became oppressive. I realized I was slowing, as if I were fighting a current and feeling tired from it. Nearly to the end of the hall, Solis, who was several steps ahead of me, stopped and turned toward a narrow door on his left.<br><br>I moved to catch up with him&#x2014;he hadn&#x2019;t even opened the door yet&#x2014;but a sudden blast of wet cold smacked me down. I stumbled to one knee, bowing my head against what felt like a deluge of icy water. Solis whipped back to stare at me and took a step away as I planted my hands on the walls and shoved my way back to my feet. Keeping my hands braced, I stood firm and shook back my hair with a sharp flip of my head....</p><h2>Evangelism after Pluralism: The Ethics of Christian Witness</h2><p>What does it mean to evangelize ethically in a multicultural climate? Following his successful <i>Evangelism after Christendom</i>, Bryan Stone addresses reasons evangelism often fails and explains how it can become distorted as a Christian practice. Stone urges us to consider a new approach, arguing for evangelism as a work of imagination and a witness to beauty rather than a crass effort to compete for converts in pluralistic contexts. He shows that the way we lead our lives as Christians is the most meaningful tool of evangelism in today's rapidly changing world.</p><p><b>"A major contribution to the study of evangelism"<br></b><br>"As one of our most well-informed and helpful theologians of evangelism, Stone has given us a wonderfully invigorating theological rationale for Christian evangelism in a pluralistic age. Here is an unapologetic (in the deepest, Barthian sense) call to evangelism in a world where many of us are intimidated by contemporary worldviews. Stone's discussion of evangelism and beauty is groundbreaking. This book enables the church to talk about the good news of Jesus in a manner that distorts neither Jesus nor the gospel."<br>--<b>Will Willimon</b>, Duke Divinity School; United Methodist bishop, retired; author of <i>Conversations with Barth on Preaching</i><br><br>"As it turns out, the loss of Christendom makes evangelism possible because now Christians, according to Stone, have an alternative to offer the world. In particular, that witness must be nonviolent, requiring as it does the respect of those who do not choose to be Christian. Accordingly Stone helps us own the vulnerability that comes from following Christ. I hope this book will become the standard in courses on evangelism in our seminaries."<br>--<b>Stanley Hauerwas</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"<i>Evangelism after Pluralism</i> is a significant book--a major contribution to the study of evangelism. Offering a probing and incisive discourse on an ethics of evangelism in relation to pluralism, Stone develops an understanding of evangelism as faithful, virtuous witness that is ecclesial, nonviolent, imaginative, and subversive. His deep engagement with pluralism in the particular cultural contexts of empire, the nation-state, and consumerism is refreshing. I commend this book to all who are concerned with integral evangelism."<br>--<b>Joon-Sik Park</b>,&nbsp;Methodist Theological School, Ohio<br><br>"Building on his earlier outstanding work <i>Evangelism after Christendom</i>, Stone masterfully navigates the complex and at times treacherous landscape of church and society. <i>Evangelism after Pluralism</i> is a must-read for those teaching, pastoring, leading, and serving in ecclesial settings that engage the world. Stone provides a stunningly sharp, wise, and insightful case for evangelistic practice."<br>--<b>Laceye Warner</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"By what waywardness have we gotten to the point that 'evangelism' means a proselytizing wrestling match between competing faiths? <i>Evangelism after Pluralism</i> offers a corrective."<br>--<b>Craig Keen</b>, Azusa Pacific University<b>Bryan Stone</b> (PhD, Southern Methodist University) is associate dean for academic affairs and E.&nbsp;Stanley Jones Professor of Evangelism at the Boston University School of Theology in Boston, Massachusetts, where he also codirects the Center for Practical Theology.

The ice in front of him is lit with a pale blue-green radiance. There, embedded in he pure, antediluvian glacier, Byrne sees something that will inextricably link him to the vast bed of ice, and the people who inhabit this strange corner of the world. In this moment, his life becomes a quest to uncover the mystery of the icefield that almost became his tomb. <br> Within the deceptively simple framework of a tourist guidebook, <i>Icefields</i> takes a breathtaking, imaginative look at the human spirit, loss, myth, and elusive truths. Here is an impressive literary landscape, and an expedition unlike any you have ever experienced.</p><p>This first novel begins with an imaginative and ingenious premise: a physician trekking across the Arcturus Glacier in the Canadian Rockies in 1898 slips and tumbles into a crevasse, where he beholds a winged human figure. The rest of the book tells of Dr. Edward Byrne&#39;s efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery in the ice. Along the way, he encounters a series of eccentrics, each involved in their own quest: the explorer Freya; the industrialist Trask; the poet Hal; and the slightly mad Elspeth, Byrne&#39;s lover. Told through scientific notes, journal entries, letters, and dialogue, this historical tale of the incalculable encountered in the mountains marks a promising debut.On August 17, 1899, a British doctor nearly dies while exploring the Arcturus glacier near Jasper, Alberta. In his best-selling novel, Thomas Wharton recreates Dr. Edward Byrne&#39;s story. Obsessed with the icefields, Byrne gives up his London practice, settles on the edge of the glacier, and watches Jasper change from a place of myth into a tourist town.</p><h2>The Astrolabe World Ephemeris: 2001-2050 At Noon</h2><p>Featuring Longitudes and Declinations for the Sun, Moon, Planets, Chiron and the Asteroids.

It was still another to read it and know, from the advance reports of Spanish readers, that Bola�o's true masterpiece was still to come. And here it is: <i>2666</i>, the 898-page novel he sprinted to finish before his early death in 2003, again showing Bola�o's mesmerizing ability to spin out tale after tale that balance on the edge between happy-go-lucky hilarity and creeping dread. But where the motion of <i>The Savage Detectives</i> is outward, expanding in wider and wider orbit to collect everything about our lonely world, <i>2666</i>, while every bit as omnivorous, ratchets relentlessly toward a dark center: the hundreds of mostly unsolved murders of women in the desert borderlands of <i>maquiladoras</i> and <i>la migra</i> in northern Mexico. He takes his time getting there--he tells three often charming book-length tales before arriving at the murders--but when he does, in a brutal and quietly strange landscape where neither David Lynch nor Cormac McCarthy's Anton Chigurh would feel out of place, he writes with a horror that is both haunting and deeply humane. <i>--Tom Nissley</i><p><b>ROBERTO BOLA�O </b>was born in Santiago, Chile, in 1953.

Wellman, whose eighty-two movies (six of them uncredited), many of them iconic; many of them sharp, cold, brutal; others poetic, moving; all of them a lesson in close-up art, ranged from adventure and gangster pictures to comedies, aviation, romances, westerns, and searing social dramas.<br> &nbsp;<br> Among his iconic pictures: the pioneering World War I epic <i>Wings </i>(winner of the first Academy Award for best picture), <i>Public Enemy </i>(the toughest gangster picture of them all), <i>Nothing Sacred,</i> the original <i>A Star Is Born,</i> <i>Beggars of Life, The Call of the Wild, The Ox-Bow Incident, Battleground, The High and the Might</i>y...<br> &nbsp;<br> David O. Selznick called him &#x201c;one of the motion pictures&#x2019; greatest craftsmen.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Robert Redford described him as &#x201c;feisty, independent, self-taught, and self-made. He stood his ground and fought his battles for artistic integrity, never wavering, always clear in his film sense.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wellman directed Hollywood&#x2019;s biggest stars for three decades, including Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck, John Wayne, Lauren Bacall, and Clint Eastwood. It was said he directed &#x201c;like a general trying to break out of a beachhead.&#x201d; He made pictures with such noted producers as Darryl F. Zanuck, Nunnally Johnson, Jesse Lasky, and David O. Selznick.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here is a revealing, boisterous portrait of the handsome, tough-talking, hard-drinking, uncompromising maverick (he called himself a &#x201c;crazy bastard&#x201d;)&#x2014;juvenile delinquent; professional ice-hockey player as a kid; World War I flying ace at twenty-one in the Lafayette Flying Corps (the Lafayette Escadrille), crashing more than six planes (&#x201c;We only had four instruments, none of which worked. And no parachutes . . . Greatest goddamn acrobatics you ever saw in your life&#x201d;)&#x2014;whose own life story was more adventurous and more unpredictable than anything in the movies. Wellman was a wing-walking stunt pilot in barnstorming air shows, recipient of the Croix de Guerre with two Gold Palm Leaves and five United States citations; a bad actor but good studio messenger at Goldwyn Pictures who worked his way up from assistant cutter; married to five women, among them Marjorie Crawford, aviatrix and polo player; silent picture star Helene Chadwick; and Dorothy Coonan, Busby Berkeley dancer, actress, and mother of his seven children.<br> &nbsp;<br> Irene Mayer Selznick, daughter of Louis B. Mayer, called Wellman &#x201c;a terror, a shoot-up-the-town fellow, trying to be a great big masculine I-don&#x2019;t-know-what. David had a real weakness for him. I didn&#x2019;t share it.&#x201d; Yet she believed enough in Wellman&#x2019;s vision and cowritten script about Hollywood to persuade her husband to produce <i>A Star Is Born</i>, which Wellman directed.<br> &nbsp;<br> After he took over directing <i>Tarzan Escapes</i> at MGM, Wellman went to Louis B. Mayer and asked to make another Tarzan picture on his own.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What are you talking about? It&#x2019;s beneath your dignity,&#x201d; said Mayer. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To hell with that,&#x201d; said Wellman, &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t got any dignity.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now William Wellman, Jr., drawing on his father&#x2019;s unpublished letters, diaries, and unfinished memoir, gives us the first full portrait of the man&#x2014;boy, flyer, husband, father, director, artist. Here is a portrait of a profoundly American spirit and visionary, a man&#x2019;s man who was able to put into cinematic storytelling the most subtle and fulsome of feeling, a man feared, respected, and loved.</p><p><b>William Wellman, Jr.,</b> is the author of <i>The Man and His Wings</i>. His articles have appeared in <i>Film Comment, Films in Review,</i> and <i>DGA News</i>. He is an actor and screenwriter and was executive producer of <i>Wild Bill: Hollywood Maverick</i>. He lives in Sherman Oaks, California, with his wife.<i>From chapter 6: The Director's Board</i><br><br>As a contract director at Fox Studios, Wellman earned $185 a week. After seven pictures, his salary was . . . $185 a week. The seventh film, <i>The Circus Cowboy</i>, premiered June 19, 1924, at the Loew&#x2019;s in New York City. This effort was also produced and directed by Wellman, and once again starred Buck Jones and Marian Nixon.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Variety</i>, June 29, 1924: &#x201c;Once in a while along comes a picture full of melodrama with high strung and far fetched situations which, neverthe�less, gets over through the excellent direction and strength of the story. This is one of those rarities.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, at least, Wellman could afford his own place. Several months earlier, he had said goodbye to Dan Dix and Virgil, and moved into an apartment a few blocks from the studio. It had two rooms plus a bath�room with a shower. One room was a combination living room and bedroom, with a pull-down wall bed. The other was the kitchen. Fortu�nately, the apartment was large enough to accommodate Wellman&#x2019;s new roommate&#x2014;a big chow dog.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before <i>Cowboy </i>had gone into production, Wellman had found Chow, as he named him, walking the streets in much the same way as he had done looking for places to live near the studios where he was employed. Wellman put up notices around the area, then hoped nobody would respond. Nobody did, and the roommates became great pals. Wellman put together a large dog bed, placing it next to his pull-down.<br> &nbsp;<br> The initial problem was Chow&#x2019;s eating. Dog food was expensive. Often they ate the same things, but Chow&#x2019;s portions were larger than his master&#x2019;s and he wanted to eat more often. In order to save food money, Wellman made a deal with his landlord that covered six months at a time. The second problem was what to do with the dog when Wellman was working. The landlord introduced him to an elderly female tenant in their building. She liked animals and took on the job of feeding Chow and letting him out once during the day. This worked quite well.<br> &nbsp;<br> The whole business of working hard for almost a year, making seven quality pictures, but receiving no raise, was definitely wearing on Well�man. He was a big studio contract director. Why should he have to worry about feeding his dog? He had gotten nowhere with studio executives; his agent told him not to rock the boat, that he had a good deal and a bright future. Wellman was not convinced. He even discussed the matter with Chow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Chow and I went walking in the hills, Chow full of pep, me full of hatred that had been ripening in the last few Buck Jones pictures. My hatred was no raise in salary . . . I really got mad and explained the whole bloody business to Chow, there was nobody around except the squirrels who stopped their tree climbing the minute we came within ear shot. They didn&#x2019;t even move, just sat very quietly listening to a dumbwit talk�ing business to a dog.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> On Monday morning, the great mogul William Fox arrived at the stu�dio. Since nobody would give Wellman a break, he decided to take things in his own hands and go see the big man. <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>: &#x201c;Wil�helm Fried Fuchs . . . motion picture executive who built a multimillion-dollar empire controlling a large portion of the exhibition, distribution, and production of film facilities during the era of silent film.&#x201d; At the tender age of nine months, his German-Jewish parents changed his name to the direct English translation, William Fox. Known as &#x201c;W.F.,&#x201d; he was a publicity-shy individual whom the press called &#x201c;a brilliant, excited, ener�getic, roughneck.&#x201d;<br><br>Wellman sat in the roughneck&#x2019;s office all day waiting for an audience. W.F. knew he was there and guessed for what reason. &#x201c;Funny how flying could enter this problem but it did, and in a very understandable way. I was never afraid while flying fighting, some few times I couldn&#x2019;t breathe for a while, but it passed and the fear, such as it was, changed to a fright�ful anger, topped by a desire to kill. That&#x2019;s a hell of a topper. Being afraid of a man named Fox was as ridiculous as if I were going to have a fist fight with a nun.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was getting late and the secretary was preparing to leave. She repeated the familiar phrase that had been used throughout the day, &#x201c;Mr. Fox is too busy to see you today.&#x201d; Suddenly, W.F.&#x2019;s door opened and out he came on his way home. He stopped, looked at Wellman, and said, &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; Wellman answered with two words, &#x201c;A raise.&#x201d; He answered back with two words, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re fired,&#x201d; and went out into the hallway. Wellman followed behind, reminding him that he had made seven pictures for the same salary. W.F. turned and restated, &#x201c;You heard me, you&#x2019;re fired.&#x201d; With this, Wellman grabbed hold of his necktie at the throat and twisted it tight. He considered exploding a right fist in his startled face, then reconsidered after seeing the fright in the mogul&#x2019;s eyes. No more words were spoken. &#x201c;I saw the fear of a coward on his face, so I did the thing a face like that deserved, I spit on it. I went out of the studio for good, he went back to his office to cleanse his face of the only sincere tribute he had received for a long time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wellman&#x2019;s name came down from the directors&#x2019; board at the Fox Stu�dios, and wouldn&#x2019;t appear on any other studio billboard for a long time. His agent was disappointed; however, he told the unemployed director that with his credits, jobs would come soon. Soon didn&#x2019;t happen. The rumor was out that Wild Bill had hit the saliva bull&#x2019;s-eye, and W.F. made sure the studio executives got the word&#x2014;Wellman was blackballed. This state of exclusion would last for over a year.</p><h2>Spode &amp; Copeland: Over Two Hundred Years of Fine China and Porcelain (Schiffer Book for Collectors with Price Guide)</h2><p>Over 440 vivid color images display the wide range of ceramics produced by the English pottery firm, established by Josiah Spode in the 1760s and continuing today.

Tim and his mother were given Sanskrit names, dressed entirely in orange, and encouraged to surrender themselves into their new family. While his mother worked tirelessly for the cause, Tim--or Yogesh, as he was now called--lived a life of well-meaning but woefully misguided neglect in various communes in Oregon, England, India, and Germany. When the movement finally collapsed amid allegations of mass poisonings, attempted murder, and tax evasion, Tim and his mother started a new life. In this poignant and funny memoir, Tim Guest chronicles his experience of being left alone on earth while his mother hunted heaven, and concludes with a heartening account of how they find each other again. <br> [Tim Guest s] wonderful account of a frankly ghastly childhood is hilarious and heartbreaking, and it says much for the resilience of the human spirit that he has grown up sound in mind and body without a trace of bitterness towards his mother. --<i>Daily Mail</i> (London) <br>"A unique, eloquent, child's eye view of growing up in a commune and the price paid for a parent's search for bliss.

Handsome and charismatic, he generally kept a low profile. But in his mind he was a superstar . . .</i><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> A musical prodigy who never realized his potential, Shore found a way to outsmart society&#x2014;by getting away with murder. And he wanted the whole world to know it. After brutally killing a 16-year-old girl, he called the local NBC affiliate and told an editor precisely where to find her body.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eight years passed before DNA evidence caught up with Shore. Subsequent police investigations revealed a violent megalomaniac who had sexually abused his own daughters. He confessed to murdering four females, one only nine years old. And he hinted at many, many more&#x2014;leading authorities to believe that Anthony Allen Shore could even be the notorious &#x201c;I-45 Serial Killer,&#x201d; whose bloody legacy had earned for one Texas highway the grisly moniker &#x201c;Corridor of Blood.&#x201d; Bestselling author Corey Mitchell recounts the case from its twisted beginnings to its chilling conclusion . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;A must-read, cautionary tale of manipulation, control, and murder.&#x201d;</b><br> <b>--Diane Fanning</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;Corey Mitchell empathized with crime victims in a unique and personal way.

In August 1974, a young Frenchman named Philippe Petit boldly&#x2014;and illegally&#x2014;fixed a rope between the tops of the still-young Twin Towers, a quarter mile off the ground. At daybreak, thousands of spectators gathered to watch in awe and adulation as he traversed the rope a full eight times in the course of an hour. In <i>Man on Wire</i>, Petit recounts the six years he spent preparing for this achievement. It is a fitting tribute to those lost-but-not-forgotten symbols of human aspiration&#x2014;the Twin Towers.</p><p><strong>Philippe Petit</strong> spends most of his time high-wire walking. The rest of his time he divides between New York City and a hideaway in the Catskills.On the morning of August 7, 1974 having already illegally rigged and walked steel cables between the towers of Notre Dame in Paris and Australia's Sydney Harbor Bridge French funambulist Petit illegally rigged 200 feet of 7/8" steel cable between the two World Trade Center towers and walked between them repeatedly, lying down at one point and making eight crossings in all. This incredible feat resulted from six years of obsessive planning and problem-solving, meticulously documented in this engrossing, truly exhilarating account of how he pulled it off. Petit has penned four previous books in French regaling his various exploits, and here establishes an elegantly energetic and quirkily poetic English as he tells of secretly (and benignly) casing the World Trade Center, assembling his team of helpers for the enormously complicated (and improvised) rigging job, getting the heavy cable and rigging tools to the roof, running the wire across in the dead of night (via an arrow shot between the towers!), and tightening the cable: "Even in the midst of the hardest rigging job or most demanding clandestine adventure, I never fail to pause and admire the moment when tension brings my cable to what I consider its most seductive shape. Then I pause and smile back." The way in which the walk itself stopped traffic and galvanized the city is captured in Petit's descriptions and the 140 b&amp;w photos (including Petit's notebook sketches), a most fitting remembrance of the World Trade Center as a piece of New York social architecture. The spirit behind Petit's form of trespass undertaken with enormous care, to the point of wrapping the rigging in carpet so it would not damage the towers acts directly against the violation of the city's structures and the murder of its people. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Make Me Pull Over!: An Informal History of the Family Road Trip</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A lighthearted, entertaining trip down Memory Lane&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>),<i> Don&#x2019;t Make Me Pull Over!</i> offers a nostalgic look at the golden age of family road trips&#x2014;before portable DVD players, smartphones, and Google Maps.</b><br><br>The birth of America&#x2019;s first interstate highways in the 1950s hit the gas pedal on the road trip phenomenon and families were soon streaming&#x2014;sans seatbelts!&#x2014;to a range of sometimes stirring, sometimes wacky locations.

CHAPTER 1<p></p> Swerving through the Seventies<p></p> A Family Boldly Leaves Its Driveway<p></p> <br>One winter evening in 1976, when I was seven years old, I went to sleep in my bed in Wisconsin and woke up in a snowdrift in Indiana. I had little idea how I&#x2019;d gotten there.<br> <br>I dimly recall my father&#x2019;s arms cradling me as I looked up through eyelids heavy with sleep. I watched the white ceiling of the hallway turn into the shadowy pine rafters of our garage, then the fuzzy tan fabric of our family car&#x2019;s interior. I remember being tossed across the laps of my older brothers in the backseat, a pillow pushed under my head, and a blanket thrown over my body. Then I drifted off again into blackness.<br> <br>Next came a startled yelp. I opened my eyes to find myself tumbling in a blur of stuffed animals, eight-track tape cartridges, Styrofoam coffee cups, and issues of Dynamite magazine. I landed on the car&#x2019;s floor with a thud, the round hump of the transmission housing pressed into my belly, my chin burning from sliding on the shag carpet.<br> <br>I had no idea where we were. But I knew where we weren&#x2019;t&#x2014;anywhere near the sunny beach in Florida that I&#x2019;d been listening to my mom tell us about for weeks. All I could surmise was that I was in our car and it was cold and dark and eerily quiet. Even the engine was still. Finally, my dad&#x2019;s voice cut the silence.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeez, Louise! Everyone okay? Anyone hurt?&#x201d; my dad asked, his head swiveling around from my mom and sister beside him in the front seat to my brothers and me in the rear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wha-what happened?&#x201d; my mom replied, dazed. Like me, she&#x2019;d just been roused from a deep sleep to find herself on a whirling carnival ride.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa! We did at least three three-sixties!&#x201d; gushed my thirteen-year-old brother, Bruce, a little too enthusiastically for the rest of us.<br> <br>&#x201c;The highway just became a hockey rink!&#x201d; my dad explained. &#x201c;Cars spinning everywhere! It&#x2019;s a wonder we didn&#x2019;t smack into anyone!&#x201d;<br> <br>My twelve-year-old sister, Leslie, who got motion sickness from riding escalators at the mall, didn&#x2019;t say a word. She just stared straight ahead in her usual position between my parents in the front seat, trying not to barf all over the dashboard.<br> <br>After counting heads to make sure none of us had been launched into orbit, my parents quickly assessed our situation. The car was upright, though pitched at an unnerving angle. Good. No one had any obvious fractures or gushing head wounds. Good. Not a single window showed a crack. Also good. The worst that could be said was that all of the loose contents inside our car&#x2014;maps, Thermoses, shoes, me&#x2014;were scattered about as though our vehicle had been picked up and shaken like a snow globe. But then that was how the inside of our car generally looked while on a road trip anyway. What was unusual was how dark it was. The only light inside our car streamed in shafts through gaps of thick snow caked on every window.<br> <br>Dad turned the ignition key. To our surprise, the engine roared to life, pressing the windshield wipers suddenly back into action. As they labored to push the clumps of snow aside, we got a better view of our predicament. Our car had come to rest well off the interstate, halfway down a broad slope that served as one side of a wide V-shaped highway median. Since I was only seven years old, I didn&#x2019;t dwell on the delicate nature of our predicament; instead, I thought about what a great sledding hill this would make&#x2014;had we been on Dad&#x2019;s prized wood toboggan and not inside our 1975 Lincoln Continental Town Car. We weren&#x2019;t alone. As far as we could see, ahead of us and behind, vehicles were scattered about the interstate like toy cars dropped by a cranky toddler.<br> <br>Dad pulled his door handle, allowing a ferocious blast of frigid air to swirl inside. The door barely budged, blocked by a mound of thigh-high snow outside. Dad&#x2019;s blood pressure instantly redlined. &#x201c;Cripes Jiminy!&#x201d; It was one of many colorfully benign phrases he kept ready to avoid blurting out a real ear burner in front of us kids. Others included: &#x201c;Gee willikers!&#x201d; &#x201c;For crying out loud!&#x201d; and his ever reliable go-to nonexpletive, &#x201c;Criminently!&#x201d; That they made no sense wasn&#x2019;t important. It was enough that they kept him out of the doghouse with my mom and the Catholic Church.<br> <br>Dad slammed the door back and forth against the snowdrift like a battering ram. This took no small effort. The door of a mid-seventies Lincoln was only a slightly smaller version of the one guarding the entrance to a NORAD command bunker. Eventually he cleared enough space to slip outside, and my mom turned off the engine.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no sense wasting gas,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We may be here a while, and we&#x2019;ll need the heater.&#x201d; My mother was nothing if not practical. &#x201c;Now did any of you happen to pack candy bars or anything else to eat?&#x201d;<br> <br>We hadn&#x2019;t been stuck in the ditch five minutes, and my mom was already formulating a rationing scheme to improve our chances of survival. If raising four kids had taught her anything, it was to always prepare for the worst.<br> <br>Mom and my brothers also began to piece together the morning&#x2019;s events. As usual, we&#x2019;d left our home in suburban Milwaukee hours before daybreak. Getting an early start was critical&#x2014;we had to get through Chicago before rush hour or we&#x2019;d lose two hours just crawling from one side of the city to the other. Dad&#x2019;s strategy was to pack the car the day before our departure. Then, promptly at 3:00 a.m. the following morning, he&#x2019;d storm through the house, flipping on lights and hollering orders like a drill sergeant at reveille. As the baby of the family, and the one most likely to cause a delay, I was simply scooped from my bed, still clutching my beloved blankey, and carried out. Dad would deposit me in the backseat, jump behind the wheel, and we&#x2019;d be off in a cloud of leaded gas fumes. We&#x2019;d be a hundred miles from home before any of us were really conscious enough to grasp what had happened.<br> <br>However, that morning my oldest brother, fifteen-year-old Mark, had remained awake. He recounted for the rest of us how the miles had passed uneventfully at first and how we&#x2019;d even made it through Chicago in record time. But as we crossed Illinois into Indiana, it had begun to snow, and the light flurry quickly whipped into a raging squall. As we reached an exposed stretch of interstate south of Gary, Indiana, whiteout conditions slowed traffic to a crawl&#x2014;but not slow enough, it turned out. Whipping winds had polished the moist pavement into a sheet of black ice, and without warning, a car ahead of us went into a spin. Trying to avoid a collision, trailing drivers hit their brakes, sending them into swirls of their own. Almost miraculously, Mark continued, no vehicles collided. Instead, each found its way into the snowy sloping median on one side of the interstate or down the steep embankment on the other. Of course, he couldn&#x2019;t be sure. We&#x2019;d been busy spiraling into a ditch of our own.<br> <br>The driver&#x2019;s door popped open, and my dad clamored inside, his face red with cold. &#x201c;I talked to a trucker with a CB down the road. He said a fleet of wreckers are on the way. With any luck, we&#x2019;ll be back on the road in a couple hours!&#x201d;<br> <br>So we waited. Six of us huddled in a jumbo road barge beached on a highway median waist deep with snow. We&#x2019;d all just been nearly killed in a horrible crash in Nowhere, Indiana. We&#x2019;d have to endure hours of delay before reaching our hotel (and its pool and game room) that evening. We had no smartphones, no DVD players, no iPods to keep us entertained. Those were all years, even decades, from invention. In our remote location, we couldn&#x2019;t even find a radio station signal strong enough to get the local news. Really, we had nothing except each other.<br> <br>Years later, we&#x2019;d all agree it was the best start to a family road trip ever.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>If there was ever a time Americans needed a vacation, it was the 1970s. Nearly everyone had a good reason to pack up their station wagon or VW minibus and leave it all behind.<br> <br>The gloomy conclusion to the war in Vietnam had sent morale plummeting, while race riots taking place across the country kept tensions high. Unemployment and inflation skyrocketed and remained elevated so long that economists had to coin a whole new term for the phenomenon: stagflation. All the term really meant was that although the seventies also gave us great new things like backyard hot tubs, home VCRs, and countertop microwave ovens, fewer people could afford them. The pressure of making ends meet also helped push the traditional nuclear family into meltdown. The number of divorces filed in 1975 doubled that of a decade earlier. Couples who did stay together had fewer children. The U.S. birthrate plunged to its lowest level since the Great Depression&#x2014;half that of the baby boom years. Even the government appeared to be falling apart. Just years into the decade, first a vice president and then a president were forced to resign amid allegations of corruption&#x2014;and hardly anyone placed much faith in the officials who remained.<br> <br>Not even a night at the movies offered much escape. In keeping with the sour mood, many popular movies of the seventies centered on disasters, demons, and dark conspiracies. Audiences were trapped in The Towering Inferno or booked on a doomed flight in any of three Airport movies. If you avoided being swallowed up by the ground in an Earthquake, you might be devoured by the Jaws of a great white shark. The Exorcist offered a hell of a fright. And if the devil didn&#x2019;t get you, the government would, even if it took All the President&#x2019;s Men. If you somehow managed to avoid all that, you could still be subjected to Linda Blair shaking her booty in Roller Boogie. It&#x2019;s hard to say which fate was most horrifying.<br> <br>Things got so bad that Americans tried just about anything to find relief, from joining the Moonies (a controversial religious movement blending teachings of many faiths nicknamed for its founder, Sun Myung Moon) to disco dancing to learning to macram�. They were desperate times indeed.<br> <br>All things considered, it isn&#x2019;t surprising that many people, including my parents, decided the best plan was simply to sit out as much of the seventies as possible at some distant beach, historic battlefield, or theme park. Anywhere but home.<br> <br>Despite the flagging economy, Americans continued taking vacations throughout the seventies in record numbers, just as they had since the close of World War II. Thanks to two decades of prosperity, increasingly generous terms of employment, and broader acceptance of the benefits of taking time off from work, more Americans than ever before were able to escape the daily grind, if only for a couple of weeks each year. In fact, 80 percent of working Americans took vacations in 1970, compared to just 60 percent two decades earlier. As a result, attendance at national parks, historic sites, and other attractions surged 20 to 30 percent every year until 1976. Only then did the decade&#x2019;s second major fuel crisis force many families to pull the plug on their trip to see Old Faithful or halt their march to the Gettysburg Battlefield.<br> <br>To reach these far-off places, my family, like most others, traveled by car. It wasn&#x2019;t that we enjoyed spending endless hours imprisoned together in a velour-upholstered cell, squabbling over radio stations and inhaling each other&#x2019;s farts. It was that we had no other choice.<br> <br>Air travel had always been too expensive for anyone not named Rockefeller or traveling on the company dime, much less a pair of middle-class parents taking four kids to the beach. Adjusted for inflation, a domestic plane ticket in the seventies cost two to three times the price of the same ticket today. Given the cost, it shouldn&#x2019;t be too surprising&#x2014;and yet still is&#x2014;that as late as 1975, four in five Americans had never traveled by plane. Not for a weekend getaway to Las Vegas, not to head off to college, not for a once-in-a-lifetime honeymoon in Paris. Never.<br> <br>Although ordinary Joes couldn&#x2019;t afford a plane ticket, nearly every family could afford a car, often two. If there was one thing America was very good at, it was producing automobiles. Following World War II, American car factories needed only to do some quick retooling to go from churning out airplanes and tanks to cranking out cars faster than ever. And thanks to a booming economy, Americans could afford to buy all those shiny new cars as fast as they rolled off assembly lines. By 1972, the number of cars on the nation&#x2019;s roads exceeded the number of licensed drivers (inviting the troubling thought that many cars were simply driving themselves around). What&#x2019;s more, Americans loved to get behind the wheel. During the 1970s alone, Americans logged 14.4 trillion highway miles&#x2014;enough to travel from Earth to Pluto and back 2,500 times. To be sure, most travelers selected closer destinations, as there are so few decent hotel options along that route even today.<br> <br>My family alone was responsible for approximately 1 trillion of the miles logged by travelers in the seventies. At least that&#x2019;s how it seemed to me: as the youngest of four kids, I was the one relegated to the backseat, rear window shelf, or rear cargo compartment of a series of fine American automobiles purchased by my father over the course of the decade. Together, we toured the country (well, half of it, anyway&#x2014;we rarely traveled west of the Mississippi) in week-long journeys taken two and sometimes three times a year.<br> <br>We were hardly pioneers, of course. By the time we got rolling on our family road trips, Americans had already been beating a well-worn path to the Grand Canyon and sunny beaches of Florida for more than half a century. But for much of that time and in many areas of the country, the routes those motorists took were often little more than dirt tracks. Even in populated areas, drivers often had to pick their way through a confusing maze of privately owned turnpikes and poorly constructed two-lane highways built simply to connect one town to the next.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t until well after World War II that America got serious about making long-distance road travel fast, safe, and convenient. That&#x2019;s when the country began rolling out the first of its mighty interstates, the so-called superhighways. The interstates were marvels of a modern era, unlike any roads Americans had traveled before. These high-speed highways weren&#x2019;t narrow and hemmed in by trees and tall buildings. They were wide and broad-shouldered, with huge swaths cleared on both sides to invite in sunshine and blue sky. What&#x2019;s more, they were elevated well above the surrounding terrain, affording drivers and passengers a panoramic view of the landscape. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the interstates was the way they instantly made the country seem so much smaller. Suddenly it was possible to travel from one state to the next and even one coast to the other in a fraction of the time it once took. Places many Americans could once only read about in newspapers or see pictures of in magazines were now all within reach, given a reliable car and enough cash for fuel. What&#x2019;s more, the whole family could come along. In an automobile, four or five people could travel nearly as cheaply as one.<br> <br>Making things even nicer for my family, many of the interstates had been around long enough by the 1970s for an ample number of restaurants, gas stations, motels, and other conveniences to sprout up along their sides...</p><h2>Waiting for Gospel</h2><p>&#34;Christianity, as faith centered in Jesus as the Christ came to be called, got a foothold in the world, and for a vital and vocal minority changed the world, because it proclaimed a message that awakened men and women to possibilities for human life that they had either lost or never entertained. That message the first Christian evangelists (and Jesus himself, according to the record) called euangellion-good news, gospel. For its first two or three hundred years, Christianity was largely dependent for its existence upon the new zest for life that was awakened in persons who heard and were, as they felt, transformed, by that gospel; and at various and sundry points in subsequent history the Christian movement has found itself revitalized by the spirit of that same &#39;good news&#39; in ways that spoke to the specifics of their times and places. &#34;The lesson of history is clear: the challenge to all serious Christians and Christian bodies today is not whether we can devise yet more novel and promotionally impressive means for the transmission of &#39;the Christian religion&#39; (let alone this or that denomination); it is whether we are able to hear and to proclaim . . . gospel! We do not need statisticians and sociologists to inform us that religion-and specifically our religion, as the dominant expression of the spiritual impulse of homo sapiens in our geographic context-is in decline. We do not need the sages of the new atheism to announce in learned tomes (and on buses) that &#39;God probably does not exist&#39; The &#39;sea of faith&#39; has been ebbing for a very long time&#34; -from the Introduction</p><p></p><h2>Parecon: Life After Capitalism</h2><p>&#x2018;What do you want?&#x2019; is a constant query put to economic and globalization activists decrying current poverty, alienation and degradation.

Yet in doing so, the author draws a clear distinction between the Nazi esoteric doctrine, - which is elitist, supra-national, and spiritual -, and the popular, nationalist exoteric doctrine. She then endeavours to establish a clear link between the Nazi secret doctrine and Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy, revealing both the occult character of Esoteric Nazism and the pagan Aryanism of Nietzsche. The book has therefore a two-fold contribution: it unveils the Nazi esoteric doctrine, which the author claims is purely Nietzschean in character, and analyses Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy in order to extract from it a clearly eugenicist, Aryanist dimension, thus establishing a clear link between the German philosopher&#39;s thought and the Nazi Secret Doctrine. The author thus unveils both Nietzsche&#39;s universal Aryanism as well as Nazism&#39;s esoteric doctrine. This subject is of great interest to all those interested in a deeper understanding of the spiritual dimension of Nietzsche&#39;s thought, as well as the occult nature of Nazism, and the relationship between these two doctrines. The book aims to end the controversy that is still ongoing today as regards Nietzsche&#39;s relation to Nazism, by showing that the exoteric side of Nazism, which focuses on nationalism and biological racism, had little to do with Nietzsche&#39;s elitist, universal and spiritual Aryanism, thus coming up with the conclusion that Nietzsche&#39;s influence was essentially on the esoteric, spiritual, secret doctrine of Nazism.</p><p>Thinker, writer and poet, Abir Taha holds a postgraduate degree in Philosophy from the Sorbonne, and is a career diplomat for the government of Lebanon, having previously served as the Consul at the Lebanese embassy in Paris Taha is an expert in Nietzschean thought. For years she has extensively read, studied, and analysed Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy. She has written several studies and dissertations on philosophy and political theory, particularly Nietzschean thought. Whereas most Nietzsche scholars ignore the spiritual dimension of Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy, the author contends that there lies the essence of the great German philosopher&#39;s work. She thus put special focus on Nietzsche&#39;s spirituality, which is deeply influenced by Greek and Indian philosophy. Having deep knowledge of Western and Eastern esoteric thought and the influence of esoteric schools on current political ideologies, the author underwent extensive research on Nazism and its occult roots, paying special attention to Nietzsche&#39;s influence on what she calls &#34;Esoteric Nazism&#34;, thus unveiling the Nazi Secret Doctrine and establishing a clear link between Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy and Nazism as a spiritual Weltanschauung.

He carved out an illustrious career and made films that transformed the Hollywood studio yarn into a thrilling art form. Walsh belonged to that early generation of directors&#x2015;along with John Ford and Howard Hawks&#x2015;who worked in the fledgling film industry of the early twentieth century, learning to make movies with shoestring budgets. Walsh's generation invented a Hollywood that made movies seem bigger than life itself.<br><br>In the first ever full-length biography of Raoul Walsh, author Marilyn Ann Moss recounts Walsh's life and achievements in a career that spanned more than half a century and produced upwards of two hundred films, many of them cinema classics. Walsh originally entered the movie business as an actor, playing the role of John Wilkes Booth in D. W. Griffith's <i>The Birth of a Nation </i>(1915). In the same year, under Griffith's tutelage, Walsh began to direct on his own. Soon he left Griffith's company for Fox Pictures, where he stayed for more than twenty years. It was later, at Warner Bros., that he began his golden period of filmmaking. <br><br>Walsh was known for his romantic flair and playful persona. Involved in a freak auto accident in 1928, Walsh lost his right eye and began wearing an eye patch, which earned him the suitably dashing moniker "the one-eyed bandit." During his long and illustrious career, he directed such heavyweights as Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Errol Flynn, and Marlene Dietrich, and in 1930 he discovered future star John Wayne.</p><p><b>Marilyn Ann Moss</b> is the author of <i>Giant: George Stevens, A Life on Film</i> and has published numerous articles on writers such as Paul Bowles, Theodore Dreiser, and Frank Norris.

Encompassing such key works such as Lawman s <i>Brut</i> and Wace's <i>Romance of Brut</i>, written in Middle English and Old French, respectively, the Arthurian Epic Tradition depends on Geoffrey of Monmouth's <i>History of the Kings of Britain</i>, written in Latin.

Grove Press is proud to reissue his haunting noir novel <i>The Speed Queen. The Speed Queen</i> is the gripping story of a twisted love triangle's drug-fueled killing spree across the desert plains, told in the voice of Oklahoma death-row inmate Marjorie Standiford, who is recounting her experiences for a best-selling horror writer researching the murders. It's a chilling, unputdownable crime novel in the tradition of James M. Cain -- a voyage into the dark soul of the American West.</p><p>Stewart O'Nan's <i>The Speed Queen</i> opens on Oklahoma's death row. Marjorie Standiford, scheduled to die that night for the murder of 12 people, dictates the story of her life into a tape recorder. Before she goes, she wants to set the record straight. It seems that one of her accomplices, Natalie, has already produced a bestselling book on the subject, and Marjorie doesn't want to be outdone. Her tape will be sent to an unnamed writer known as the King of Horror with a list of titles identical to those of Stephen King. <p> It's evident why a horror writer might be interested in Marjorie's story--the details of her life are pretty darned horrifying. A deep love of cars is what attracts Marjorie to her husband, Lamont, in the first place; an unplanned pregnancy is what pushes them into marriage. In the early days of their love affair, driving around in Lamont's convertible with the baby in the back and doing a little speed on the side is enough, but possession leads to prison time for Marjorie. There she meets Natalie, who will complete their deadly triangle. Once on the outside, Natalie, Marjorie, and Lamont start mainlining speed, then dealing it, and before long, a landscape of drive-thru restaurants and convenience stores becomes the backdrop for a series of gruesome murders. Marjorie may not be the most reliable narrator, but she is an original one, and <i>The Speed Queen</i> provides one heck of a joy ride.</p>Here's a little insight into publishing. There are tons of people that work on each book in different ways - publicity, promotion, sales reps, production, managing editorial, and a bunch of other people you've never even imagined. One of things editorial has to do is write up a little description that everyone can access to in order to have some clue as to what the book is about. After all, everyone can't read every single book. There are just too many. This book was purchased by my boss during my first few months. It was one of the first books that I worked with that I truly enjoyed. Here's a small part of what I wrote for The Speed Queen: "In her manipulative, ignorant, calculating but vulnerable voice we hear a character that one reviewer called 'straight out of David Lynch'. She is funny, lovable, terrifying and crazy in a way that feels like home. Stewart O'Nan creates a character that could easily be the confused girl you knew from high school. Set against the backdrop of milkshakes, french fries, low-paying jobs, drugs and highways, Marjorie is someone that we understand because she is a part of America." I actually meant that.<br><br>-- S.

Recognizing that they shared a love of science (as well as good food and drink) they began to meet on Sunday mornings to talk about the state of science in Britain and the world at large. Inspired by the great 17th century scientific reformer and political figure Francis Bacon&#x2014;another former student of Cambridge&#x2014;the Philosophical Breakfast Club plotted to bring about a new scientific revolution. And to a remarkable extent, they succeeded, even in ways they never intended. <br><br>Historian of science and philosopher Laura J. Snyder<i> </i>exposes the political passions, religious impulses, friendships, rivalries, and love of knowledge&#x2014;and power&#x2014;that drove these extraordinary men. Whewell (who not only invented the word &#x201c;scientist,&#x201d; but also founded the fields of crystallography, mathematical economics, and the science of tides), Babbage (a mathematical genius who invented the modern computer), Herschel (who mapped the skies of the Southern Hemisphere and contributed to the invention of photography), and Jones (a curate who shaped the science of economics) were at the vanguard of the modernization of science. <br>&nbsp;<br>This absorbing narrative of people, science and ideas<i> </i>chronicles the intellectual revolution inaugurated by these men, one that continues to mold our understanding of the world around us and of our place within it. Drawing upon the voluminous correspondence between the four men over the fifty years of their work, Laura J. Snyder shows how friendship worked to spur the men on to greater accomplishments, and how it enabled them to transform science and help create the modern world.<br><br>"The lives and works of these men come across as fit for Masterpiece Theatre.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>"Snyder succeeds famously in evoking the excitement, variety and wide-open sense of possibility of the scientific life in 19th-century Britain...splendidly evoked in this engaging book.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>American Scientist</i><br></b><br>"This fine book is as wide-ranging and anecdotal, as excited and exciting, as those long-ago Sunday morning conversations at Cambridge.&nbsp;<i>The Philosophical Breakfast Club</i>&nbsp;forms a natural successor to Jenny Uglow&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Lunar Men...</i>and Richard Holmes&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Age of Wonder.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Washington Post</b> <br></i></p><p>An expert on Victorian science and culture, Fulbright scholar Laura J.

The Lancaster Canal would wend its way from Preston, in the south, where the Ribble River reached into the Irish Sea, up past Garstang, an arm of the canal dipping again into the sea at Glasson, before winding through Lancaster and heading north to Kendal, at the edge of the Lake District. In 1794, at the height of the Industrial Revolution, manufacturing and engineering ruled Britain, and both were present at the great work of building this canal.<br><br>Whewell would grow up surrounded by the canal works and the great waterway itself, impressed with these monuments to the immense powers of human invention and technology. Later he would come to see himself as an engineer of Science, plotting the course of a mighty body, just as the canal's engineer, John Rennie, had planned the path of a mighty waterway. This child of the Industrial Revolution would one day initiate a Scientific Revolution that would change the world.<br><br>The story of the canal begins in 1772, when a group of Lancaster merchants came together with the idea of constructing a new waterway that would connect with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, near Wigan, and proceed northward through Preston and Lancaster to Kendal. Work on canals had been going on for some decades, ever since 1755-61, when the Sankey Brook in Lancashire had been turned into a canal for bringing cheap coal to Liverpool; after that, an age of canal building was begun, powered by the industrialists who wanted cheap means of transporting their goods from factories to markets.<br><br>In recent times the port of Lancaster had been one of the busiest in Britain. Even today, many fine Georgian buildings stand in the port area, constructed during its heyday in the mid-eighteenth century. But by the last third of the century, trade to the port had been suffering from the silting-up of the Lune estuary, which led from the Irish Sea three miles inland to Lancaster. The newer, larger ships could not make it through the river up to the port.<br><br>Lancaster was a major manufacturer of linen textiles, mostly sailcloth. The firms producing the heavy canvas were owned by "flaxmen," suppliers of flax, who transformed themselves into manufacturers by fitting up rooms with heavy sailcloth looms and facilities for warp-winding and starching. If shipping ceased in Lancaster, so would the sailcloth trade. Merchants in Lancaster glanced enviously at their counterparts in Liverpool, who were thriving-in great part because of the success of the Leeds-and- Liverpool Canal.1<br><br>The Lancastrians first approached James Brindley, who had designed the famous Bridgewater Canal, which brought coal to Manchester from the Duke of Bridgewater's collieries at Worsley. The first of the great canals, the Bridgewater was an engineering wonder, with its fingers reaching deep into the mine at Worsley, its aqueduct over the Irwell River carrying barges high in the sky, and its destination in Manchester: a tunnel leading the coal right into the center of the city. Ill health forced Brindley to pass the Lancaster job along to his son-in-law, Robert Whitworth. Debates over Whitworth's plans, and those of his successors, dragged on for almost twenty years.2<br><br>Finally, in 1791, impatient merchants and rattled traders petitioned Mayor Edward Suart for a public meeting to decide once and for all whether a link with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal would be pursued. At that meeting, a resolution was passed approving the building of a canal. John Rennie-renowned for fitting out corn mills, for his drainage works in the fens, for building waterworks, docks, and harbors-was asked to submit a plan. His survey differed from the earlier ones by proposing to cross the deep Ribble Valley with a tramway rather than with the canal itself, so the canal would be cut in two sections, north from Preston and south from Clayton, connected by a long bridge passing over the valley. Only the southern part of the Lancaster Canal would connect by water with the Leeds-to- Liverpool waterway. But Lancaster would have its connection to the sea, at nearby Glasson. An act of Parliament was obtained to authorize the new navigation, and work on the canal began late in 1792.<br><br>Less than two years later, William Whewell came into the world: on May 24, a birthday he would share with the young princess Victoria when she was born twenty-five years later. As a baby and young boy he was sickly; his parents secretly worried over him, especially when they lost two other infant sons soon afterwards. But he would grow up to be a tall, strapping man, one whose physical vigor became, to many, a symbol of his intellectual strengths.<br><br>His parents were John and Elizabeth Whewell, who lived on Brock Street in Lancaster, a short distance to the west of the canal works. Both John and Elizabeth were twenty-five when they married; William arrived a scant nine months later. John Whewell was a house carpenter and joiner with a workshop employing one or two journeymen. The business built houses, including the door frames and window frames, repaired fences, and possibly constructed cabinets as well. His people had come to Lancaster from Bolton, farther north in Lancashire, half a century before.3 John Whewell was admitted by all to be a man of great sense.<br><br>Elizabeth Whewell was of the old Lancaster family of Bennisons. An intelligent and cultured woman, Elizabeth published her poems in the Lancaster Gazette, the first local newspaper; she bestowed upon her son a love of reading and writing poetry that he never lost. Elizabeth died in 1807, when William was thirteen. He lost his father in 1816, soon before receiving his fellowship at Trinity College. William would also lose three brothers: not only the two who died in infancy, but also a third, John, with whom William was close. Born in 1803, John died when he was eight years old, soon after William left home for Cambridge. From the letters William sent John from school, it is apparent that John, too, was a boy of uncommon abilities; in what would be his last year he was already writing poetry judged quite fine by William, who nevertheless cautioned him, "I would not have you write so much as to neglect reading." Already a teacher at heart, William suggested to John that he study history and parts of natural philosophy, as they were "not above your comprehension."4 William had three sisters. One, Elizabeth, died in 1821; in later life he corresponded frequently with his remaining sisters, Martha and Ann, though they did not see each other often.<br><br>No images of William's parents remain, as is to be expected in this time before photography was invented; only the wealthy or important had portraits made. But we can infer from the numerous engravings, paintings, and photographs of William that his father, like William, was tall and vigorous, and that both parents were handsome. Surely they were pleased with their firstborn, who undoubtedly learned quickly; though, if later personality is any indicator, he was a strong-willed toddler who always wanted to have his way.<br><br>During William's early years Lancaster was overtaken by hundreds of "navvies"-a name originating from a shortening of "navigators"-who descended on the market village from all over England and Ireland to dig the new canal. (The canal workers would give their nautical name to the hordes later brought in to build the railways, even though the railway workers no longer had anything to do with the sea.) These were hard-drinking men with rough ways, frightening to many, tolerated because of the difficult and often dangerous work they alone were willing to do. First, the ground had to be dug out with pickaxes and spades, and carried away by barrows; when lucky, the navvies had horses to help with the pulling. Then the layers of sedimentary rock beneath the soil had to be blasted with gunpowder, often unpredictable in its force. When the deep channel was finally dug out, the most tedious part of the work began: lining the canal with "puddle," a type of clay kneaded with water. The puddle was spread throughout the dug channel, and then pounded down tight. Sometimes local farmers allowed the navvies to drive their cattle up and down the canal. But often the navvies themselves agonizingly tramped over the puddle, back and forth, for weeks, usually barefooted.<br><br>To a young boy the scene would have been almost irresistible: the sound of the gunpowder blasting, the men swearing, the horses complaining; the smell of the earth, the dung, the sweat, the smoke; checking every day to see how much progress had been made-how much deeper was the channel, how much longer the circuit. As William grew, he would often marvel at the ingenuity and engineering skill that had been required to build the bridges linking roads on either side of the canal, so that the waterway could be crossed by foot or with a horse and carriage, and the aqueducts designed to carry barges traveling on the canal over rivers and streams; in the case of the giant Lune Aqueduct, boats were carried sixty-two feet in the air, on a conduit six hundred feet long, traversed by huge pillars supporting five semicircular arches.<br><br>There were other changes in Lancaster, no less telling of the times than the new canal. Soon after William was born, a prison was built inside Lancaster Castle for "those who were charged with the crime of poverty," as a contemporary visitor put it: a debtors' prison.5 In those days of war with France, slow trade, and high food prices brought on by bad harvests, many families suffered, and it was easy for a man to find himself in debt merely by trying to feed his children. Other, more dangerous felons were put in the new prison as well. The castle's use as a prison, as well as the courts that were housed within it (which sentenced more people to be hanged than any other court outside London) was also meat for the imagination of a young boy, as well as a warning of what could happen to a man who fell on hard times.<br><br>The modern age-with its technological triumphs and its economic tribulations-was present all around William. Yet his future seemed destined to follow a pattern set over centuries: just like any boy of his circumstances for hundreds of years, he was to continue in his father's trade, and take over his business. Instead, his future swerved off course, in a way no one could have imagined.<br><br>At first, William was sent to the "Blue School" in Lancaster. Blue Schools were charity schools set up in the eighteenth century to educate the children of the working classes; the name referred to the blue uniforms the students often wore. His parents wanted him to know how to read and write, and do sums, and the education at the Blue School was provided for free. He attended school in the mornings and worked with his father in the afternoons. On Sundays, after church, he read the Bible and poetry with his mother. Soon he would leave school to work with his father full-time. William enjoyed carpentry, and had a flair for it, and he did not chafe against this plan.<br><br>William's destiny changed one day in late 1808 or early 1809.6 He was helping his father repair the rail fence separating the backyards of the Owen family and the Reverend Joseph Rowley, the parish curate and headmaster of the local grammar school. William would later become close friends with Richard Owen, ten years his junior, the future comparative anatomist (the one who coined the term dinosaur), and it is Owen's recollections of that day that preserve the occasion.<br><br>"Between noon and two p.m. we left school for dinner, and Mr. Rowley found Whewell's son in the garden, his father having gone to his dinner," Owen remembered years later. "He entered into a conversation with the boy, who was_._._._about to be apprenticed to his father, and was struck with his replies to questions as to what he had learnt, and especially in regard to his arithmetic." When William's father returned, Mr. Rowley told him his opinion of the boy's superior abilities, and proposed that he should leave the Blue School and go to the grammar school, which was not free and so was generally reserved for boys from more-prosperous families. Rowley also hinted at the greater opportunities this would offer the young boy.<br><br>John Whewell was, understandably, worried about losing William for the carpentry business: "He knows more about parts of my business now than I do, and has a special turn for it," he protested. (This is how Owen described his response. In Whewell's Lancaster accent, it would have sounded more like this: "Worrall eye do wit'owt 'em? 'Es reet gradely wit' a hommer," or, "What will I do without him? He's really very good with a hammer.")7 But out of deference to the clergyman, he agreed to think it over. Mr. Rowley added that he would supply the boy with books, and waive all the fees. John Whewell consented; William went to the grammar school. Forty years later, William said of Rowley that "he was the one main cause of my being sent to college, and of all my subsequent success."8<br><br>William's move to the grammar school was, as might be imagined, difficult. He was by then a tall, ungainly lad, and because he was behind the others in nearly all subjects, he was put in a class with the younger boys. But the rate at which he mastered both English and Latin grammar was "a marvel." Before the first year was out, William had moved up into the class of boys his age. His proficiency in and excitement about the subjects did not endear him to the others; the headmaster, seeing how quickly William completed the lessons, gave all the boys more work to do. In the tradition of schoolboys of all time, they threatened him: "Now, Whewell, if you say more than twenty lines of Virgil today, we'll wallop you!"<br><br>But that was easier said than done. Whewell was good with his fists, and not afraid to use them. In later years he would be known for his tough physicality, which masked an inner insecurity about his humble origins. As Owen recalled, "I have seen him, with his back to the churchyard wall, flooring first one, then another, of the 'walloppers,' and at last public opinion in the school interposed. 'Any two of you may take Whewell in a fair stand-up fight, but we won't have more at him at once.' After the fate of the first pair, a second was not found willingly."9<br><br>One day in the summer of 1809, Mr. Rowley sent William over to the Bridge Inn, between Lancaster and Kendal, to meet an acquaintance of his-Mr. Hudson, a fellow and tutor of Trinity College-in order to determine what chances of success William would have at Cambridge. We can only imagine the trepidation the fifteen-year-old would feel on making the short journey, knowing as he did how his fate hinged on its outcome. Hudson quizzed the boy on his mathematics, telling him at the end of the meeting, "You'll do; you'll be among the first six wranglers," that is, one of the graduating students with the highest scores on the honors examination.<br><br>Attending Cambridge had been the plan all along; there was no point to William's getting the grammar school education if he were going to work as a carpenter afterwards. Graduating with honors from Cambridge would give him the opportunity to try for a fellowship, which would support him in an extremely comfortable manner, with little labor, as long as he remained unmarried. If he decided to have a family, he could hope for a position as a parish curate, perhaps combined with one of the few professorships available to married men.</p><h2>Red Tide: A Billy Knight Thriller (Billy Knight Thrillers, 2)</h2><p>From Jeff Lindsay, the bestselling author of the Dexter series, comes the long-awaited sequel to his debut novel, <i>Tropical Depression</i>, featuring ex-cop Billy Knight.<br><br> Billy Knight wants to ride out Key West&#x2019;s slow-season with the occasional charter and the frequent beer.

Racing northward at speeds approaching sixty miles an hour, cutting telegraph lines and destroying track along the way, Andrews planned to open East Tennessee to the Union army, cutting off men and mat�riel from the Confederate forces in Virginia.

He pursued the <i>General</i> until, running out of wood and water, Andrews and his men abandoned the doomed locomotive, ending the adventure that would soon be famous as The Great Locomotive Chase. But the ordeal of the soldiers involved was just beginning. In the days that followed, the "engine thieves" were hunted down and captured. Eight were tried and executed as spies, including Andrews. Eight others made a daring escape to freedom, including two assisted by a network of slaves and Union sympathizers.

The Bible, he says, is the mystery story of God&#39;s hidden presence as the Divine Suspect behind all history. Capon discusses the misuse of Scripture due to literalist interpretation, looks at the ways Christ has suffered at the hands of human image-makers, and proposes a novel understanding of salvation history that clarifies the proper roles of Scripture, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus.&#34; &#34;In the second part of the book Capon turns his magnifying glass on major thinkers from church history - Irenaeus, Athanasius, Anselm, Luther, Melanchthon, Calvin, Julian of Norwich, and others - pointing out both the strong and the weak images they have produced. Throughout the centuries, Capon sees God as the &#34;Divine Bowler&#34; trying to knock down the faulty &#34;pins&#34; of ideas that have been set up in the lanes of religious history, while also disclosing himself in profound and powerful ways</p><p>ROBERT FARRAR CAPON is the author of many works on theology, cooking, and family life. He lives on Shelter Island, New York.Episcopal priest and author Capon (The Foolishness of Preaching and other works) here offers a highly engaging yet learned approach to the understanding of God. Not many could try to address the significance of God as the hidden hand of history by mixing the insights of baseball with reflections on Irenaeus and Anselm, but Capon does so with gusto.

The Sunday school classes he leads at his hometown church in Plains, Georgia, are legendary. "These weekly sessions . . . are remarkable for the ability of regular folks to walk in, grab a seat, and exchange views with the thirty-ninth president of the United States," says The New York Times. "But they are also remarkable for what Mr. Carter has to say." <br>For Sources of Strength, President Carter has culled fifty-two of his favorite Bible lessons--one for each week of the year--from the fifteen hundred or so he has taught over the decades. A thoughtful and inspiring book, Sources of Strength captured the heart of the country when it was published in hardcover, and became an immediate national bestseller. Now available in paperback, it can be enjoyed on its own or as the companion volume to Carter's bestselling spiritual autobiography, Living Faith. Jimmy Carter was president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He is the author of thirteen other books, including Always a Reckoning, The Virtues of Aging, and Living Faith. In 1982 he founded the Carter Center, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization in Atlanta that addresses national and international issues of public policy. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, live in Plains, Georgia.</p><p>"In this rich and very intimate spiritual autobiography, the former president shares his living Christian faith...With engaging humor and self-effacement, Carter shares his personal stories of the lessons of faith he has learned as a son, husband, and father."<br>--<b>Publisher's Weekly</b><p>"Former president Jimmy Carter writes with compelling honesty about his mistakes, his challenges, and his faith."<br>--<b>U.S. News &amp; World Report</b></p><p>"An unforgettable, spiritual autobiography filled with wisdom and pleas for justice...Carter's life is best summarized by the title of one of his chapters: Faith in Action."<br>--<b>Kirkus Reviews</b></p><p>"A readable, remarkable book."<br>--<b>Atlanta Journal Constitution</b></p><p>"Radiant with humility, compassion, and quiet strength, not to mention a sure knowledge of Scripture and how to cite it, this book continues Carter's witness beautifully and movingly."<br>--<b>Booklist</b></p><p><b>Audio Book Review</b></p><p>"In the beautifully read <b>Living Faith</b>, former president Jimmy Carter explains his deep belief in God...Neither preachy nor predictable, this tape will have listeners hitting the rewind button to more fully grasp Carter's words and thoughts on spirituality."<br>--<b>USA Today</b></p>Jimmy Carter was the thirty-ninth president of the United States.

The authors describe how a small band of conservatives in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War launched a revolution that shifted American politics to the right, challenged the New Deal order, transformed the Republican party into a voice of conservatism, and set the terms of debate in American politics as the country entered the new millennium. Historians Donald T. Critchlow and Nancy MacLean frame two opposing perspectives of how the history of conservatism in modern America can be understood, but readers are encouraged to reach their own conclusions through reading engaging primary documents.</p><p>Donald T. Critchlow is professor of history at St. Louis University and the author of numerous scholarly articles and books, including The Conservative Ascendency: How the GOP Right Made Political History and Phyllis Schlafly and Grassroots Conservatism. Nancy MacLean is professor of history and African-American studies at Northwestern University, and the author of Behind the Mask of Chivalry: The Making of the Second Ku Klux Klan; Freedom is Not Enough: The Opening of the American Workplace and The American Women&#39;s Movement: A Brief History with Documents.<i>Debating the American Conservative Movement</i> presents a lively, passionate argument about the rise of the New Right and its far-reaching consequences for American politics since World War II. Two distinguished historians, Donald Critchlow and Nancy MacLean, concur that the conservative movement came to power because 'ideas have consequences' but disagree on almost everything else that they discuss in this volume. Their competing perspectives on modern conservatism will help students understand the high stakes of historical debates over the legacy of the New Deal, the fate of the civil rights movement, the emergence of the Religious Right, and the meaning of the 'Reagan Revolution.' (Matthew D. Lassiter, University of Michigan, author of The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South)<br><br>A stimulating and valuable book. With vigorously argued essays by major scholars and a revealing collection of primary sources, this volume allows students to understand&#x2015;and invites them to enter&#x2015;the historical debate on this pivotal subject. (Bruce J. Schulman, Boston University, co-editor of Rightward Bound: Making America Conservative in the 1970s)<br><br>The book splits between Critchlow's sympathetic views of conservatism after World War II and MacLean's rebuttal of conservatism as a positive force in American politics. Each essay is followed by a set of primary documents designed to substantiate preceding arguments. A great guide . . . for history students. . . . The essays are critical to demonstrating how to frame ideological debates without resorting to logical fallacies and name-calling.

Hampered by unreliabilty and poor engine performance at high altitude, the P-39 nevertheless served alongside the P-40 and P-38 in the bitter struggle to capture Guadalcanal in 1942/43, as well as seeing much action over the jungles of New Guinea.

Her life is in turmoil following the collapse of her parents&#39; marriage, and the brutal murder of a local boy. When the shy bachelor from next door begins to take an interest in Marsha&#39;s mother, Marsha is drawn into a cruel spiral of events that quickly spins out of control. &#39;Immaculate and impressive&#39; - &#34;The Literary Review&#34;.</p><p>A murdered boy, a runaway husband, a family spinning out of control--Suzanne Berne's <i>A Crime in the Neighborhood</i> is no ordinary coming-of-age novel. The narrator of this dark tale of 1970s suburbia is 10-year-old Marsha, who lives with her mother and older twin siblings in a suburb of Washington, D.C. In the spring of 1972, a young boy is molested, murdered, and then dumped behind a shopping mall. That the child was not particularly likeable is just one of Berne's deviations from the expected, as clear-eyed Marsha recalls the boy's many character flaws, even as she relates the details of an undeniably horrifying crime. Though murder is the most visible crime in Marsha's neighborhood, it is by no means the only one; when Marsha's father and aunt run off together, their enormous betrayal sends Marsha's mother into a tailspin and Marsha into a strange dalliance with Mr. Green, the neighbor next door. <p> <i>A Crime in the Neighborhood</i> is a deft and provocative first novel that turns many of the coming-of-age conventions on their heads. There is nothing sepia-tinted about Marsha's recollections of her childhood--the lives of 10-year-olds are mired in the mistakes of adults and the cruelties of other children. The pitiless eye Marsha brings to bear on the friends, family, and acquaintances of her youth makes <i>A Crime in the Neighborhood</i> an unusual and worthwhile read.</p>In the summer of 1972, in a suburb of Washington, D.C., the body of a twelve-year-old boy was found near a shopping mall. He had been sexually molested and then murdered. The worst crime came later. Marsha Eberhardt was ten years old at the time of the murder. The story of how she reacted is as disturbing as the murder itself. As the adult Marsha looks back on that summer and recounts the events, she sees herself as an almost fanatically vigilant little girl edging as close as possible to every disturbance. There were all kinds of disturbances - the murder, the break-in at the Watergate that Walter Cronkite kept talking about, Marsha&#39;s own family&#39;s upheaval. Her father had deserted her. Her teenaged siblings were shoplifting. Her mother was flirting with the new neighbor next door. When the summer dragged on and on without the police solving the murder, Marsha felt compelled to put the &#34;evidence&#34; she&#39;d been collecting to use. How do crimes that we witness or commit as children continue to haunt us years later? Can we ever escape the wrongs we&#39;ve done, or the wrongs done to us? Marsha Eberhardt, a child of the seventies - of the first generation to grow up believing there&#39;s no such thing as &#34;good&#34; government, &#34;safe&#34; neighborhoods, or &#34;stable&#34; families - finds herself turning this question over and over in her mind.</p><h2>The Wrong Hostage (St. Kilda Consulting, 1)</h2><p><p>The latest masterwork from one of the leading writers of suspense . . . <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell returns with a chilling tale of the law gone wrong and a kidnapping that threatens more than one life.</p><p>The Wrong Hostage</p><p>Orphaned at thirteen, Grace Silva clawed her way out of poverty and violence to become one of the most respected judges on the federal bench. Grace believes in the rule of law -- lives it, breathes it.

He believes in the innocents, the ones getting ground up by governments that are too polarized or too corrupt to protect their own citizens. He's been through the political meat grinder himself. It cost him his career, his freedom, and the woman who still haunts him. Since then Faroe has worked outside the rules and politics of government as a kidnap specialist for St. Kilda Consulting, a Manhattan-based global business that concentrates on the shadow world where governments can't go. He is good at his work -- intelligent, confident, ruthless. </p><p>Until a friend dies trying to kill him. </p><p>Now Faroe is out of the business. Retired. He's through trying to save a world that doesn't want to be saved. </p><p>Then Grace comes to him, past and present collide, and Faroe finds himself sucked back into the shadows, tracking a violent killer who holds the life of Grace's son in his bloody hands. </p></p><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell has more than eighty titles published to date with over twenty-four million copies of her books in print. She lives in the Sierra Nevada Mountains with her husband, with whom she writes novels under a pseudonym. Her favorite activity is exploring the Western United States to find the landscapes that speak to her soul and inspire her writing.</p>A mother's worst nightmare of an endangered child is just one breathless element of Lowell's latest romantic thriller (after <i>Always Time to Die</i>). Newly divorced California judge Grace Silva discovers her billionaire ex-husband, Ted Franklin, is missing, after she's summoned to the exclusive Mexican prep school where her 15-year-old computer whiz son, Lane, is being held hostage. Ted has crossed Hector Rivas Osuna, the ruthless kingpin of the most violent crime family in Tijuana, and Grace learns that Lane will be killed if she doesn't turn over the millions Ted has stolen from Osuna. She seeks the help of Joe Faroe, an ex who predated Ted and who may be Lane's biological father; Joe works for an elite private investigation firm. Lowell's convincing depiction of the Mexican drug trade illuminates the dangerous intersection of her characters' personal lives with international politics and organized crime. Events unfold in a maze of talk and double-talk, but the payoff is solid as the family reunites, finding that both love and the price of freedom are nonnegotiable. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Edited by Ben Estes and Alan Felsenthal. Introduction by Geof Hewitt. Though Hamilton wrote thousands of poems during his lifetime, only a small percentage of them ever found their way into print. His poems appeared in small poetry journals during the 60s, 70s and 80s; two chapbooks, <em>The Big Parade</em> and <em>Sphinx</em>; and one full-length collection, <em>The Poems of Alfred Starr Hamilton</em>, published by The Jargon Society in 1970. In this new volume, Ben Estes and Alan Felsenthal present a collection of Hamilton's poems from these publications, along with many of Hamilton's poems that were previously considered lost and poems from posthumously found notebooks.<br><br>"Hamilton is the author of spare, wry, slightly surreal poems that have, so far as I can see, no real equivalent in American English."&#x2014;Ron Silliman<br><br>"Alfred Starr Hamilton 'wrote to the governor of poetry / And simply signed [his] own name.' Consider this collection&#x2014;assembled by two very dedicated allographers&#x2014;an essential expansion on said letter. People who've encountered Hamilton's work previously will be glad for the chance to see familiar poems alongside many marvelous new ones. And how I envy first-time readers of this most generous and genuine American writer."&#x2014;Graham Foust<br><br>"It is a hidden world, a hushabye place that Alfred Starr Hamilton occupies, a secluded place where he is free to summon daffodils and stars, chimes and angels, thread and old-fashioned spoons. There is Hungarian damage, blue revolutionary stars, a sedge hammer (which is not a typo). He is obsessively drawn to fine metals&#x2014;bronze, silver and gold. He would be golden, but can never grasp the elusive sad: 'One cloud, one day / Came as a shadow in my life / And then left, and came back again; and stayed' like "Anything Remembered" which is the title of that poem. He is too removed to see things any other way but his own. It is a silver peepshow in the wonderbush, and there is always a moon to scrape from the bottom of his view."&#x2014;C. D.

Yet prayer, as it is found in the Christian scriptures, has received limited attention as a topic of study. Into God&#39;s Presence explores the nature and use of prayer throughout the entire New Testament. Written by twelve leading biblical scholars with diverse confessional perspectives, this insightful volume first discusses Christian prayer in relation to prayer in the Old Testament, the Greco-Roman world, first-century Judaism, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. The rest of the book takes an instructive look at prayer as it appears from Matthew to Revelation, with special attention given to Jesus as an exemplar and teacher of prayer. &#34;Speaking of prayer in the New Testament... 12 biblical scholars including N.T. Wright and David Aune offer the anthology Into God&#39;s Presence: Prayer in the New Testament, exploring the topic by first examining prayer in the Jewish tradition, in the Greco-Roman world and in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The essays then discuss prayer in the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles, ending (of course!) with a coda essay on prayer in the Book of Revelation.&#34; - Publishers Weekly</p><p>Speaking of prayer in the New Testament... 12 biblical scholars including N.T.

An erotic love battle erupts!</li></ul></p><p>I'm torn between thinking that this release is too madcap, too silly to be tolerated and that it's absolutely brilliant. It's rare that a release makes me laugh out loud, but this one did.<br><br>At the heart, it's a really silly story. Masahiro is a law student who is madly in love with fellow student, Takane. Takane is a serial dater. He's got all kinds of sex friends.<br><br>At first, Masahiro only wanted one night with Takane, but after he's had him, he finds that he wants him all to himself. Now, he's just got to convince Takane that sleeping with Masahiro and only Masahiro will keep him satisfied, but that the sex and their feelings is enough to keep Takane from getting bored. When one of Takane's sex-friends proves more troublesome to shake than the others, it's a full-out war for Takane's affections with Masahiro leading the charge.<br><br>This really shouldn't be as good as it is, but the things that these characters say and the lengths they will go to to achieve their goals make this one into a winner. Seriously, I thought I was going to hate this release. I'm so happy when I'm proved wrong. --Boys Next Door<br><br>Admittedly, I wasn't terribbly impressed by Kazuho Hirokawa's art when I first flipped through it but if there's one thing I've learned through DMP's books inparticular, is that you can never judge a book's story by its art. In fact, I told myself going in that I'd probably love the story purely based on my apprehensive nature of the art. This isn't a ruling that always works of course, but in this case it seems my intuition was right on. The thin-lined style, strong character designs and hilarious nature of some of the facial expressions really won me over to the art which has a very loose, lively feel to it. The colourful cover should certainly garner it some attention from store shelves as well.<br><br>Overall, The Dawn of Love is a really entertaining story about a man taming a sex-addict and achieving fluffy, sex-filled love! On that note, what's a story about a sex addict without lots of sex? So certainly expect a fair amount with this one. Masahiro stole centerstage with his over-zealous personality and Takane kept the story balanced with his more level-headed attitude and fluttery-eyelashes. Together the pair made for a really interesting yaoi, and as a nicely contained one-shot, I certainly recommend it to boys love fans for a read that's lots of fun. --Kuriousity</p><h2>Obelisks: Towers of Power: The Mysterious Purpose of Obelisks</h2><p>Ancient obelisks were energy towers<br><br>David Childress, popular author and star of the History Channel&#x2019;s show Ancient Aliens, brings us a stunning tale of archeological investigation on a megalithic scale. Childress looks into the enigma of obelisks and their purpose. Egyptologists tell us that obelisks are granite towers that symbolize a ray of the sun&#x2015;a megalithic symbol of the Sun God Ra, later to be called Aton. Some obelisks weigh over 500 tons and are massive blocks of polished granite that would be extremely difficult to quarry and erect even with modern equipment. Why did ancient civilizations in Egypt, Ethiopia and elsewhere undertake the massive enterprise it would have been to erect a single obelisk, much less dozens of them? Were obelisks more than simple monuments? Were they energy towers that could receive or transmit energy? Childress takes us on an amazing journey through the history of the obelisk and its probable purpose as an energy tower. With discussions on Tesla&#x2019;s wireless power, and the use of obelisks as gigantic acupuncture needles for earth, Childress shows us what the ancients were trying to achieve with their mysterious obelisks.

Inspired by the extravagant yarns of a straight-faced former cavalry officer, Hieronymus von M�nchhausen, the best-selling legend quickly eclipsed the real-life baron who helped the Russians fight the Turks. Galloping across continents and centuries, the mythical Munchausen&#x2019;s <i>Travels</i> went through hundreds of editions of increasing length and luxuriance. <br><br>Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky, the Russian modernist master of the unsettling and the uncanny, also took certain liberties with the mythical baron. In this phantasmagoric roman � clef set in 1920s Berlin, London, and Moscow, Munchausen dauntlessly upholds his old motto &#x201c;Truth in lies,&#x201d; while remaining a fierce champion of his own imagination. At the same time, the two-hundred-year-old baron and self-taught philosopher has agreed to return to Russia, Lenin&#x2019;s Russia, undercover. This reluctant secret agent has come out of retirement to engage with the real world.</p><p><b>Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky</b> (1887&#x2013;1950), the Ukrainian-born son of Polish emigrants, studied law and classical philology at Kiev University. After graduation and two summers spent exploring Europe, he was obliged to clerk for an attorney. A sinecure, the job allowed him to devote most of his time to literature and his own writing. In 1920, he began lecturing in Kiev on theater and music. The lectures continued in Moscow, where he moved in 1922, by then well known in literary circles. Lodged in a cell-like room on the Arbat, Krzhizhanovsky wrote steadily for close to two decades. His philosophical and phantasmagorical fictions ignored injunctions to portray the Soviet state in a positive light. Three separate efforts to print collections were quashed by the censors, a fourth by World War II. Not until 1989 could his work begin to be published. Like Poe, Krzhizhanovsky takes us to the edge of the abyss and forces us to look into it. &#x201c;I am interested,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;not in the arithmetic but in the algebra of life.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Joanne Turnbull</b>&#x2019;s translations from Russian in collaboration with Nikolai Formozov include Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky&#x2019;s <i>The Letter Killers Club </i>(winner of the AATSEEL Award for Best Literary Translation into English) and <i>Autobiography of a Corpse</i> (winner of the PEN Translation Prize)."Playful and erudite, sprinkled with philosophy and politics, funny in places and melancholy in others, this novella, like most of Krzhizhanovsky's work, remained unpublished during his lifetime; how lucky that we can read it now.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews,</i> starred review<br><br>&#x201c;For all Krzhizhanovsky&#x2019;s avant-garde bona fides, few authors speak more honestly about the power great literature can exert on a reader and on its creator.&#x201d; &#x2014;Scott Esposito, <i>The National</i></p><h2>Acting Stanislavski: A practical guide to Stanislavski&#x2019;s approach and legacy</h2><p><p>Stanislavski was the first to outline a systematic approach for using our experience, imagination and observation to create truthful acting. 150 years after his birth, his approach is more widely embraced and taught throughout the world &#x2013; but is still often rejected, misunderstood and misapplied.</p><p>In <i>Acting Stanislavski</i>, John Gillett offers a clear, accessible and comprehensive account of the Stanislavski approach, from the actor's training to final performance, exploring:</p><p>� ease and focus<br>� the nature of action, interaction and objectives<br>� the imaginary reality, senses and feeling<br>� active analysis of text <br>� physical and vocal expression of character <br>� the actor in the context of training and the industry.</p><p>Drawing on Stanislavski's major books, in both English translations, and on records of his directing process and final studio classes, <i>Acting Stanislavski</i> demystifies terms and concepts.

Moore guides us through the maze of concepts and projects that constitute the multidisciplinary phenomenon of post-structuralism. Moore centers on two lengthy exegetical examples - a Derridean reading of John and his interpreters and a Foucauldian reading of Paul and his. The book also deals with deconstruction&#39;s relationship to Theology and its relationship to biblical scholarship old and new - historical critical, narrative critical, and feminist.

Here is the gutsy and often shocking world of Billy and Jackie, prison buddies on the streets and hot on the trigger.<br><br> &#x201c;All those [other black] writers, no matter how well they dealt with black experience, appealed largely to an educated, middle-class, largely white readership. They brought news of one place to the residents of another. Goines&#x2019;s novels, on the other hand, are written from ground zero. They are almost unbearable. It is not the educated voice of a writer who has, so to speak, risen above his background, it is the voice of the ghetto itself.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael Covino,&nbsp;<i>The Village Voice</i></p><p><b>Donald Goines</b>&nbsp;was born in Detroit, Michigan. He joined the U.S. Air Force instead of going into his family&#x2019;s dry cleaning business. Following his service, he entered into a life of drug addiction and crime. He received seven prison sentences, serving a total of over six years. While he was in prison, Goines wrote his first two novels,&nbsp;<i>Dopefiend: The Story of a Black Junkie&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Whoreson: The Story of a Ghetto Pimp.</i>&nbsp;Goines was shot to death in 1974.</p><h2>On the Edge</h2><p><p><strong><em><strong>On the Edge</strong></em><strong>is a monumental fresco of a brutal contemporary Spain in free fall</strong></strong></p><em>On the Edge</em> opens with the discovery of a rotting corpse in the marshes on the outskirts of Olba, Spain&#x2015;a town wracked by despair after the burst of the economic bubble, and a microcosm of a world of defeat, debt, and corruption. Stuck in this town is Esteban&#x2015;his small factory bankrupt, his investments stolen by a &#x201c;friend,&#x201d; and his unloved father, a mute invalid, entirely his personal burden. Much of the novel unfolds in Esteban&#x2019;s raw and tormented monologues. But other voices resound from the wreckage&#x2015;soloists stepping forth from the choir&#x2015;and their words, sharp as knives, crowd their terse, hypnotic monologues of ruin, prostitution, and loss. <p>Chirbes alternates this choir of voices with a majestic third-person narration, injecting a profound and moving lyricism and offering the hope that a new vitality can emerge from the putrid swamps. <em>On the Edge</em>, even as it excoriates, pulsates with robust life, and its rhythmic, torrential style marks the novel as an indelible masterpiece.</p></p><p><p>The author of nine novels and the winner of the National Prize for Literature and the Critics Prize for On the Edge, <strong>Rafael Chirbes</strong> (born in Valencia in 1949) is &#x201c;the best writer of the twenty-first century in Spain&#x201d; (ABC).</p><p><strong>Margaret Jull Costa</strong>, the three-time winner of the Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize, has also won the International IMPAC Dublin Prize and the PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize, among many others.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Valerie Miles</strong>, an editor, writer, translator, and professor, is the co-founding editor of the literary journal <em>Granta</em> in Spanish.&nbsp;</p>&#x201c;This is the great novel of the crisis.

The fumes of the lagoon mix with the lingering sulfur of the Atocha railway-station bombing; the Spanish economy has all but collapsed. Who, or what, is to blame? Chirbes&#x2019;s novel accuses everyone.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joshua Cohen, <em>Harper's</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A moving, densely detailed portrait of people without hope.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Rafael Chirbes&#x2019;s <em>On the Edge</em> is a novel for our time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Norman Rush, <em>New York Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Chirbes, one of Spain&#x2019;s premier writers, is at his best when fully immersed, as he is in this novel. If Proust and an Old Testament prophet had collaborated to write about Spain&#x2019;s recession, it might have been something like the writing here&#x2015;agonized, dense, full of rage, and difficult to forget.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Easily one of the year's finest and most important work, Chirbes's ON THE EDGE stands out as a marvel of what fiction is capable of dong (and, oh, that inescapable cover!).&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jeremy Garber, <em>Three Percent</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Utterly convincing in its psychological details, but also memorable for the beauty of its writing and rhythms.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Colm To�ibi�n</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>On the Edge</em> is masterful, a centrifugal novel with sentences like sticky tentacles that clutch onto readers and suck them into a swirling, tempestuous, pulsating center.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Valerie Miles</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Rafael Chirbes is one of the greatest European authors of our time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Le Monde</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Literature, as Adorno once said, is a clock that keeps ticking. But it is also the best tool for understanding the world when reality is torn to shreds. Both rules are strictly complied with by great authors.

What is odd is that, at fifty years old, Varamo &#x201c;hadn&#x2019;t previously written one sole verse, nor had it ever occurred to him to write one.&#x201d;<br><br> Among other things, this novella is an ironic allegory of the poet&#x2019;s vocation and inspiration, the subtlety of artistic genius, and our need to give literature an historic, national, psychological, and aesthetic context. But Aira goes further still &#x2015; converting the ironic allegory into a formidable parody of the expectations that all narrative texts generate &#x2015; by laying out the pathos of a man who between one night and the following morning is touched by genius. Once again Aira surprises us with his unclassifiable fiction: original and enjoyable, worthy of many a thoughtful chuckle, <em>Varamo</em> invites the reader to become an accomplice in the author&#x2019;s irresistible game.</p><p><p>Nominated for a Neustadt award and the Man Booker International Prize, <strong>C�sar Aira</strong> was born in Coronel Pringles, Argentina, in 1949. He has published at least one hundred books and was most recently the creator of a limited edition, &#x201c;Valise,&#x201d; for the Museum of Modern Art, NYC.&nbsp;</p><p>The poet <strong>Chris Andrews</strong>&nbsp;teaches at the University of Western Sydney, Australia, where he is a member of the Writing and Society Research Centre. He has translated books by Roberto Bolano and C�sar Aira for New Directions. He has won the Anthony Hecht Poetry Prize for his poetry and the Valle-Inclan Prize for his translations.</p>&#x201c;An avant-garde literature that combines the impossible with the real, a literature in which every statement of fact suggests its opposite and even casual observations and plot twists are turned upside down.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Greenburg, <em>The New York Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Varamo</em>, like all the Aira books in translation, is charming and infuriating, built of plain prose that blooms without warning into carbuncular visions.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ben Raliff, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Aira's prose can be slapdash, but the book teems with delightful, off-the-cuff metaphysical speculation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Aira's literary significance, like that of many other science fiction writers, comes from how he pushes us to question the porous line between fact and fantasy, to see it not only as malleable in history, but also blurred in the everyday. The engrossing power of his work, though, comes from how he carries out these feats: with the inexhaustible energy and pleasure of a child chasing after imaginary enemies in the park.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The book is structured around a series of chance encounters, while also giving Aira some asides on broader concepts like the nature of perception, the promises of narrative form, and human thought.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The novel, in enacting the criticism it mocks, is playful and clever.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Rumpus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The latest English translation in Aira&#x2019;s enormous corpus, <em>Varamo</em> accommodates his fondness for mixing metaphysics, realism, pulp fiction, and an attention to the raw strangeness of life&#x2019;s ordinary details... The eccentricity of plot here is its own pleasure, but the slow, carefully written digressions it enfolds are what make the work such extravagant fun.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alice Whitwam, <em>Coffin Factory</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Each element Aira draws our attention to is placed into sharp focus before being discussed in short, entertaining digressions. If anything, the book implies a distrust of the very notion of plot, a comfort with play, and that is why I feel it grasps something of value. Once again Aira has given us a series of memorable, highly interpretable images held together by gossamer strings of meaning.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The National</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Slim, cerebral, witty, fanciful, and idiosyncratic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Boston Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With a light, almost hypnotic style, Aira creates an intriguing balance between realism and comedic absurdity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Critical Mob</em></strong></p><h2>Inspiring Interiors from Armstrong 1950s</h2><p>Ideas, ideas, ideas... they filled the rooms highlighted in 1950s advertising by Armstrong, the leading maker of flooring and ceiling products. Here you will find over 350 photographs of room interiors that appeared in popular magazines from the &#39;50s, inspiring the looks we now associate with that decade. Each one offers new decorating ideas that set the standard for the 1950s with furniture, floor coverings, accessories, and home improvements. Examples include a boys&#39; bedroom that can reflect changing interests as the boys grow into their teens, a living room whose interior can be converted from summer to winter decor in just an hour, and a den with a &#34;secret life&#34; as a guest room. These were refreshingly new ideas in the 1950s and are still practical today.

I dreamed of all the friends I'd make, the parties I'd attend, the special boyfriends I'd bring home to meet Mommy and Daddy. Oh, if I'd only known that the coming years would bring more sadness and pain than I could ever imagine. If only I'd wished harder, dreamed longer, maybe my life would be different, maybe I wouldn't be sitting on this beach so lonely and confused.<br><br>Instead of parties and friends to occupy my time, I spend many of my days here, staring out at the ocean, thinking about Mommy and my step-daddy, about how they're gone now, dead and buried, leaving me all alone, an orphan. Of course, I'm not completely alone. I have my new family, the Logans: Grandma Olivia, Grandpa Samuel, Grandma Belinda, Uncle Jacob, Aunt Sara, and Cary, too, but they all have their own reasons for making me feel unwelcome, unwanted. After all, they hadn't asked me to come live with them. In fact, in all my sixteen years they hadn't asked for me at all.<br><br>When Mommy first brought me to Provincetown after my step-daddy died, I couldn't believe she was going to leave me with strangers. I didn't know them, and, family or not, they made it clear they didn't want to know me. They couldn't get past the fact that I was Haille's child and the Logans had nothing but hate and contempt for my mother. I begged Mommy to take me with her, not to leave me grieving all alone. I had just lost the only daddy I had ever known, and now she was leaving too! But nothing I did or said would make her stay; she was determined to become a famous actress or model and she said I would just stand in her way.<br><br>At first I believed Mommy would come back for me. Surely she would miss me as much as I missed her. Didn't she cry herself to sleep each night as I did, missing Daddy, missing our old life back in Sewell, West Virginia? But no, Mommy was too self-absorbed to miss me or think of me or even to remember to call when she said she would. I finally realized that I was stuck in Provincetown for good. Oh how I hated Mommy for being so selfish, for running off with her lover Archie Marlin and leaving me with this family who hated me, hated her, and wanted me to be someone I wasn't. It seemed the only way I fit into the Logans' life was if I replaced my cousin Laura, Cary's twin who had died in a boating accident.<br><br>But I didn't want to be Laura, I wanted to be me! But who am I? When Daddy died and I learned he was really my step-daddy, I was left with a million questions. Who was my real Daddy? Did he think of me? Did he even know I existed? I thought I could find some answers with the Logans, but they refused to discuss my search for my father and became more secretive with each question I asked. Cary was the only one who would help me, and together we learned that Kenneth Childs, a local artist and friend of the family, was once in love with Mommy and could possibly be my father.<br><br>I hadn't had long to rejoice in my news when word came that Mommy had been killed in a car accident in California. Was I never to be happy again? It seemed that whenever anything good happened to me it was always followed by some horrible tragedy. What could be worse than losing Mommy? I thought a part of me died with Daddy, but it wasn't until Mommy was gone too that I realized how truly alone I was. If only I could find my real father I knew he would make things different. Better. I would have a whole new life with him, a life where I was loved and cared for, a life like the one I remembered in West Virginia. Kenneth Childs just had to be my real daddy. He had to be.<br><br>pard<br><br><b>Chapter 1: Curiosity Killed the Cat</b><br><br>"I'm leaving, Aunt Sara!" I shouted toward the kitchen as I hurried to the front door after hearing Kenneth Childs blow the horn of his jeep. Cary had introduced me to Kenneth at the beginning of the summer, and it wasn't long after that Kenneth hired me to be his assistant. Kenneth was mostly a loner and a bit of a slob, so I helped him around the house, cooking, cleaning, generally keeping him organized, as well as helping him around his art studio. As I cleaned and swept and dusted I waited, waited for him to open up to me, to tell me if I was his daughter.<br><br>When Grandma Olivia revealed that my true grandmother was really her sister Belinda, I realized that Uncle Jacob and Aunt Sara were not actually my uncle and aunt; they were my cousins, as were Cary and May. But because Jacob was my step-father's brother, I continued to call him Uncle and call Sara, Aunt Sara. Cary was happier knowing we weren't as closely blood related as we both originally thought. Ironically, this made him behave more shyly toward me, as though now that a true relationship was not forbidden as some unforgivable sin, he wasn't sure how to proceed.<br><br>I put these thoughts of Cary and our blossoming friendship behind me as I grabbed my gear and headed outside to meet Kenneth.<br><br>As usual, Kenneth's dog, Ulysses, was sitting in the rear of the jeep. His pink tongue was out, and he was panting, looking as if he were smiling in anticipation of my arrival. His ebony coat had streaks of gray running through it, especially around his snout. During one of Kenneth's rare warm moments, he told me Ulysses had become sprier since I had begun to look after him. "Despite his age," Kenneth added, for Ulysses was nearly a hundred in human years.<br><br>So far, that remark about Ulysses was the closest Kenneth had come to giving me a compliment. He had merely grunted his approval when he saw how well I had cleaned and organized his home, and he simply nodded when I did the same in the studio. Most of the time, he was so absorbed in his work, we barely spoke. He made it clear from the beginning that he wouldn't tolerate any interruptions to his concentration, so once he stepped into that studio and began something, I had to move like a ghost.<br><br>"An artist has to step out of the real world and dwell in the world of his own creation if he is to succeed," he explained. "It takes a while to get there, and when he's jarred out of it, for whatever reason, it's like starting all over again each time he goes back to what he was doing. Understand?"<br><br>I nodded and he seemed satisfied.<br><br>"Morning," he said as I stepped up and into the jeep.<br><br>"Good morning."<br><br>I had my hair brushed back and tied with one of Laura's mauve silk ribbons and I was wearing what was to become my summer uniform: a sweatshirt and dungarees and a pair of sneakers without socks. The sweatshirt was navy blue with Provincetown printed on it in faded white lettering and it, too, had been Laura's.<br><br>When I had first arrived in Provincetown to live with Uncle Jacob and Aunt Sara, I felt funny wearing Laura's things. I saw how much it bothered Cary, but if I refused to wear anything Aunt Sara suggested I wear, she became very hurt. Now, Cary accepted it and I...I had the feeling Laura would want me to wear her clothes, even though I had never met her and knew her only from what I heard and the pictures of her I had seen.<br><br>Ulysses leaned forward for my hug and licked my face.<br><br>"Good morning, Ulysses." I laughed. "Don't eat me for breakfast."<br><br>"I think it's going to be overcast all day today. Might even rain," Kenneth said as he turned the jeep around and we bounced over the road.<br><br>For New Englanders, especially Cape Codders, I thought, the weather was the safest topic to discuss. Everyone had something to say about it, and it usually had nothing to do with politics or religion, although I had heard Judge Childs at one of Grandma Olivia's formal luncheons recently blame the Democrats for too much rain last year.<br><br>"I don't mind the thunderstorms. We had them in West Virginia, but I wouldn't want to be in a hurricane," I said.<br><br>"No. I've been in a few and they're not pleasant."<br><br>We turned onto the highway and headed out toward the Point, where Kenneth lived and had his studio. Although the jeep rode well enough, it looked as weathered and worn as an old pair of shoes, the sort you hated to give up because they were so comfortable. Despite his success as an artist, Kenneth had few of the trappings of wealth. He just didn't look as if he belonged in a shiny new luxury automobile. It would be impractical for him to drive it over the beach road to his home anyway.<br><br>I had been working for him only a little more than a week, but I already knew that he didn't spend much time relaxing by the ocean. Occasionally, he went for a walk to think through something artistic that confused him, and it was mainly from those walks and the driving he did in the open jeep that he got his bronze color. His darkened complexion brought out the hazel specks in his otherwise often dark brown eyes, especially during the morning hours, when he looked so bright and alert.<br><br>As usual, he wore a pair of leather sandals, ragged jeans, and one of his faded blue T-shirts. This one had some small holes down the right side. With his full beard looking a bit more straggly than usual, he could easily pass for a homeless man, I thought. However, he did keep his dark brown hair neatly tied in a pony tail. Most of the time, he simply had it tied with a short piece of string. Today he had it bound with a thick rubber band. He had a small gold dot of an earring in his right lobe, and wore a shiny piece of black driftwood shaped in a half moon tied around his neck with a string of tiny sea shells.<br><br>He drove quietly, his eyes fixed on the road, his face so still, it reminded me of the faces on his statues. There was just the slightest twitch in the muscles of his jaw. I thought he had the type of face that would make any woman's heart flutter when he looked her way, or even when he didn't.<br><br>Despite the cloudy sky, the air was warm. Provincetown was crowded with summer tourists. There was much more automobile traffic than usual, and even at this early hour, there were people walking along the streets. Kenneth didn't rage about the invasion of outsiders as did so many other Cape Codders I had met. He spent so little of his time in town, he didn't seem to notice or care. And then, of course, there was the prospect of his works being sold faster when the tourists arrived. Their dollars were just as good as local dollars he told me when I mentioned Uncle Jacob's attitude.<br><br>"Did you see anything in the marble block yet?" I asked as we approached the beach road that wound around and over the dunes to his home and studio.<br><br>He glanced at me quickly, looked forward, and then shook his head.<br><br>"Nope," he said. "Nothing."<br><br>"How can you be sure it will come?" I asked. It took him so long to respond, I thought he wasn't going to answer.<br><br>"It always has before," he finally said.<br><br>The first day he brought me to the studio to work for him, I saw he had a six-foot-tall by nearly four-foot-wide block of marble. He told me it had been delivered the week before.<br><br>"It's just like a blank canvas," he explained. When I said I didn't understand, he approached it, put his hand on the stone, and lowered his head as if in prayer. Then, he walked around the piece as he began his lecture.<br><br>"The ancient Greeks believed the artistic work was already in the stone. The artist's job is to free it, to bring it out."<br><br>"It's in the stone?"<br><br>"Yes," he said, almost smiling at my incredulity. "This is what is meant by the artist's vision. In time it will appear to me."<br><br>I stared at the marble, looking for some hint, some small indication of a shape within, but I saw nothing. At the time I wondered how long it would be before he saw something. According to him it had been over two weeks and he still hadn't, but he didn't seem upset or nervous about it. He had a patience, a calmness, I had already come to admire.<br><br>Although I had been trying to ask him casually about himself all week, I still knew very little about him. He never volunteered any information and getting him to answer my questions was like pulling porcupine quills out of a hound dog.<br><br>The house and studio came into view.<br><br>"Were you always artistic?" I asked. "Even as a child?"<br><br>"Yes," he said. We pulled up to the house and he turned off the engine. Then he reached back for a bag of groceries he had bought before picking me up.<br><br>"Did my mother ever see anything you created?" I asked quickly. He didn't pause. He opened the door, the groceries under his arm.<br><br>"Everyone I know has seen something I did one time or another," he said and headed for the house. I watched him in frustration as he walked away from my questions. I keep giving him opportunities to open up a conversation about the past, I thought, and every time, he shuts the door in my face. No matter how hard I struggled to find a common ground, a topic of conversation that would lead us to talk about the past and maybe produce the revelations I expected, Kenneth either ignored me or changed the subject. So far, he had succeeded in keeping himself shut up in his work and his private thoughts.<br><br>I got out of the jeep, Ulysses following behind me.<br><br>Kenneth paused at the door.<br><br>"Just put all this away and then come to the studio. I want you to prepare some clay. I've decided to do those vases for the Bakerfields to kill time while I wait for my vision. They've been after me for months and they have so much money, it's obscene. Might as well help them lessen the burden of their wealth," he added dryly and entered the house.<br><br>Were all artists as disdainful of their customers? I wondered. He acted as if he were doing everyone who liked his art work a favor, instead of being grateful for all the attention he was receiving. Hundreds, probably thousands of artists would die to be in his shoes, I thought.<br><br>I was beginning to wonder if I even liked the man who could be my father, much less ever come to love him. Was it possible for me to love him anyway? Is blood enough to bind two people? Surely love had to come from other things, the most important of which was trust. Trust was coming hard to me these days, as one by one everyone and everything I'd come to believe in had let me down.<br><br>When I decided to take the job and work for Kenneth, I hoped that just being around him, seeing how and where he lived, would make it possible for me to understand him, but Kenneth's house, furniture, clothing, and possessions were as inscrutable as everything else in his life. The day Cary first brought me to the house, I ventured up to the front windows and peered in. Cary had described Kenneth's furniture as something from a thrift store. When I looked in, I realized he hadn't been exaggerating.<br><br>I did the best I could with the thinned and frayed rugs and the worn easy chair, settee, and scratched wooden tables, however polishing and cleaning only seemed to bring out their age and damage. But the house did need a good onceover. I found cobwebs in almost all the corners and sand tracked in everywhere. The windows were clouded with salt and dust and the kitchen was a disaster. The stove was caked with grime, the stove top stained. It took me most of my first week just to get the kitchen clean enough to use. Again, I wondered if all artists were like Kenneth Childs, and if they were, why would anyone really want to be one?<br><br>His bedroom wasn't any different from the rest of the house. I could have planted flowers in the dirt under the bed and behind the dresser. I swept and washed the wooden floors. I took all of his clothes out of the closet and organized them, after I had washed and ironed most of them.

Covering all of Eastwood's 32 films, including <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i>, <i>Unforgiven</i>, <i>Mystic River</i>, <i>Million Dollar Baby</i>, and <i>Letters from Iwo Jima</i>, the book is a full-career retrospective. To portray the maverick behind the camera, author Michael Goldman interviewed Eastwood; his longtime crew of award-winning cinematographers, editors, and production designers; and many celebrated actors, including Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Gene Hackman, Sean Penn, Meryl Streep, Hilary Swank, and Forest Whitaker.</p><p><b>Michael R.

This classic of armored warfare is both combat biography and unit history, as Patrick Agte focuses on the life and career of Wittmann but also includes his fellow Tiger commanders in the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler. Volume One covers the Eastern Front, where Wittmann racked up more than 100 kills and participated in the Battle of Kursk in 1943.</p></li></p><p>Patrick Agte has written a biography of another renowned tank commander, Jochen Peiper (0-921991-46-0).</p><h2>The Panzer IV: Hitler&#39;s Rock (Images of War)</h2><p>The Panzerkampfwagen Mk IV proved to be the one constant in Hitler's Panzerwaffe throughout the Second World War - the German equivalent of the American Sherman and the Soviet T-34. In this companion volume to his best-selling visual histories of the Tiger and Panther tanks, Anthony Tucker-Jones provides a concise account of the Mk IV's design, development and performance in combat. The Mk IV served on every major front, in France, the Balkans, North Africa, the Soviet Union and, at the end of the war, in Germany itself - it was a key weapon in the blitzkrieg attacks launched early in the war and in the later desperate defense of the Reich.<br><br>Using over 150 rare wartime photographs, plus a selection of specially commissioned color, he describes how the initial design of the Mk IV was modified and refined throughout the course of the conflict to counter the threats posed by ever more formidable Allied tanks and antitank guns on the battlefield. While the Mk IV was never produced in the same numbers as the leading Allied tanks, it was without doubt one of the principal armored vehicles of the Second World War, and Anthony Tucker-Jones's highly illustrated history is the ideal introduction to it.</p><p>Anthony Tucker-Jones is a former defence intelligence officer and a widely published expert on regional conflicts, counter-terrorism and armoured and aerial warfare.

(<i>Military Model Scene</i>)</p><h2>Through the Dark Continent: Volume 2</h2><p>Perhaps best known as the intrepid adventurer who located the missing explorer David Livingstone in equatorial Africa in 1871, Henry Morton Stanley (1841-1904) played a major role in assembling the fragmented discoveries and uncertain geographical knowledge of central Africa into a coherent picture. He was the first European to explore the Congo River; assisted at the founding of the Congo Free State, and helped pave the way for the opening up of modern Africa.<br>In this classic account of one of his most important expeditions, the venerable Victorian recounts the incredibly difficult and perilous journey during which he explored the great lakes of Central Africa, confirming their size and position, searched for the sources of the Nile, and traced the unknown Congo River from the depths of the continent to the sea. Accompanied by three Englishmen and a crew of Africans, Stanley left Zanzibar in 1874. He traveled to Lake Victoria, which he circumnavigated in his boat, the <i>Lady Alice.</i> Almost immediately, illness, malnutrition and conflicts with native tribes began to decimate his followers. Nevertheless, the explorer pushed on, also circumnavigating Lake Tanganyika, which he determined to be unconnected with the Nile system. Finally in 1876, Stanley was ready to undertake "the grandest task of all" &#x2014; exploring the Livingstone (Congo) River. He sailed down the vast waterway to the lake he called Stanley Pool, then on to a series of 32 cataracts he named Livingstone Falls. Unable to go further by boat, Stanley continued overland, reaching the Atlantic Ocean on August 12, 1877. Mishaps, hostile tribes, and disease had killed his three white companions and half the Africans, but Stanley had attained his objective.<br>His tremendous perseverance (his persistence led his men to nickname him Bula Matari &#x2014; "the rock breaker") was complemented by Stanley's abilities as a keen observer and accomplished prose stylist. These talents are fully evident in this exciting narrative. It offers not only the action and adventure of a life-and-death struggle to survive in the African wilderness, but detailed descriptions of native peoples, customs, and culture; the flora and fauna of central Africa; and a wealth of geographical, ecological, and other information. Supplemented with 149 black-and-white illustrations and a foldout map, this monumental narrative will be welcomed by anyone interested in the European exploration of central Africa during the nineteenth century, the exploits of one of the great explorers of all time, and a breathtaking story of human endurance and achievement in the face of immense odds.</p><p></p><h2>ABCDuane: A Duane Michals Primer</h2><p>The legendary photographer relates intimate themes of his life and art in a scrapbook memoir illustrated by his works&#x2014;from portraits of Magritte to Warhol, to painted tintypes, and the revolutionary multiple-image sequences and handwritten texts for which he is best known&#x2014;and by pieces from his personal art collection, now donated to Pittsburgh&#x2019;s Carnegie Museum of Art. <br> &nbsp;<br> Whether a portrait of Eug�ne Atget by Berenice Abbott, collages by Joseph Cornell, or drawings by David Hockney, the works of Michals&#x2019;s artistic lodestars sit alongside his own haunting images&#x2014;some never-before-published&#x2014;and his mordantly funny, playful, humble, and heartbreaking observations on art, photography, and life&#x2014;revealing the creative obsessions of a uniquely beloved artist. <br> &nbsp;<br> The images and texts by Duane Michals assembled here are, like the artist himself&#x2014;impossible to categorize; perhaps there is no better way to organize them than alphabetically.<i> </i>Whether recalling encounters with many of the past century&#x2019;s most illustrious artists (Balthus, Duchamp), celebrating literary heroes (Whitman, Joyce), addressing essential human concerns (Grief, Children&#x2019;s Stories, Homosexuality, God), or revealing deeply personal snippets of life with a partner suffering from dementia (Fred Said)&#x2014;<i>ABCDuane</i> is a creative autobiography and the perfect primer for Michals&#x2019;s vastly influential body of work&#x2014;both for those who have loved it for the past half-century, and those being delighted by it for the first time.</p><p>Duane Michals (b. 1932) is an American photographic artist noted for his creative extension of the possibilities of the photographic medium. Alongside a career as a freelance photographer working in fashion and advertising, Michals explored multiple exposures, sequences, series, and combinations of text and drawings. Ever since his first major solo exhibition, at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970, his work has been consistently published and exhibited worldwide.<b>A <i>TIME</i> Best Photobook of 2014<br></b><br>"What is disarming&#x2014;and unique&#x2014;about Duane Michals' ideas is the humble means by which he chooses to translate them. His repertoire of special effects is stubbornly unflashy. Instead of smoke machines or lens distortion or solarized tone reversal, or anything in the digital toolbox, he makes long exposures and has his actors move. The treat of Mr. Michals' own art collection inlcudes drawings by Balthus, David Hockney, an etching by Giorgio Morandi and lithographs by Magritte. Most artists wouldn't risk the comparison. Mr. Michals has nothing to fear. His art doesn't look like anyone else's."<br>&#x2014;<i><b>The Wall Street Journal</b></i><br><br>"Michals has continually rebelled against and expanded the documentary and fine art traditions. As an expressionist, rather than going out into the world to collect impressions of the eye, he looked inward to construct the images of his mind, exploring the unseeable themes of life, death, sensuality, and innocence. Once a radical outlier, now a father of dominant trends, he inspired generations of photographers from Jim Goldberg and Cindy Sherman, to the countless others staging, scribbling over, and painting on their photographs today." <br>&#x2014;<b><i>American Photo</i></b><br><br>"This is a retrospective not of&nbsp;Duane Michals' work but, rather, his sensibility. Here in one small volume is all the wit, charm, serious intent, and artfulness of Michals himself, plus his signature antic wisdom to make it a joyful ride."<br>&#x2014;<b><i>TIME</i></b>&nbsp;<br><br>"Duane Michals shares stories and work, much of it previously unpublished. Many of the stories are highly personal anecdontes, while others reveal something of his inspiration and philosophy."<br>&#x2014;<b><i>Photo District News</i></b><br><br>"A delectable smorgasbord of creative output. . . . Duane Michals is as skillful and entertaining in his writing as in his visual art, and the book's A-to-Z structure allows for serendipitous leaps, from the personal foibles of Lucien Freud to a poignant narrative of the death of Michals's mother, from a stunning photo of postfame Veronica Lake to irresistible Edward Lear sketches-cum-rhymes inspiring Michals's own doggerel. This quirky memoir-collage collage communicates an intelligence and generosity of spirit that derives from an alchemical amalgamation of childlike playfulness unmarred by the wisdom of experience." <br>&#x2014;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><h2>The Art of Painting in Acrylic: Master techniques for painting stunning works of art in acrylic-step by step (Collector&#39;s Series)</h2><p><p>Ideal for beginning and intermediate artists seeking to develop or polish their acrylic painting skills, <i>The Art of Painting in Acrylic</i> features a range of techniques and valuable instruction for working with this classic medium.

Then I add a medium value of moss green by mixing phthalo green, burnt sienna, and cadmium yellow medium. For the light moss, I add more yellow and use a small filbert brush to dab in the paint. Using a round brush, I paint the branches with a mix of burnt umber and titanium white, adding shadows and highlights as needed. I dab in the leaves with a mix of phthalo green and Payne&#x2019;s gray, adding cadmium yellow medium to the mix for the highlights. For the tiny flowers, I mix white with a touch of phthalo blue and apply crisscross shapes with a round brush.

Civilization (Pacem in Terris Press Booklet)</h2><p>This book describes the vision of a &#34;Green Revolution&#34; proposed by Peter Maurin, co-founder with Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker Movement. Peter&#39;s vision may be described as a new lay ecological monasticism for individuals and families. His program included three interrelated projects: 1) creation of rural ecovillages pursuing prayer, study, and agriculture; 2) creation of urban houses of hospitality to welcome the marginalized poor; and 3) ecological universities in which workers would become scholars and scholars would become workers. Peter saw the entire program as part of the search for a post-capitalist and post-Marxist new civilization, yet one rooted in ancient human spiritual, social, and ecological traditions.</p><p></p><h2>New Avengers, Vol. 1</h2><p>The Siege is over, and the Heroic Age has begun.

Volume 1 contains the commentaries on Romans, 1-2 Corinthians. Volume 2 contains the commentaries on Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1-2 Thessalonians, Hebrews, 1-2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon. &#34;While it was perhaps the work of his predecessors, especially John Chrysostom, that discouraged Theodoret of Cyrus from commenting on the Gospels, he was not deterred by &#34;the world&#39;s luminaries,&#34; as he styles his predecessors in Antioch, from writing a Commentary on the Letters of Paul. He was content, as he says, &#34;like some kind of mosquito, to buzz about the apostolic meadows along with those famous bees.&#34; Yet his Commentary is not only characterized by his distinctive gifts of moderation and conciseness, but also betrays the theological currents and controversies of those years leading up to the council of Chalcedon in 451. Revealing a fine affinity with Paul&#39;s thought, Theodoret succeeds in his aim of &#34;demonstrating the profundity of the apostle&#39;s wisdom and stripping away the veils of the writing.&#34; Now that the work appears in English, it would be to the benefit of modern commentators to sample Theodoret&#39;s approach to Paul, even if the theological positions of the Antiochene school lead the bishop to wrestle with some of his subject&#39;s cherished convictions.

His books include <i>On the Road, The Dharma Bums, Mexico City Blues, Lonesome Traveler, Scattered Poems, Visions of Cody, Pomes All Sizes, Scattered Poems</i>, and <i>Scripture of the Golden Eternity.</i>This new edition of the primary beat's private dream diaries presents the whole of Kerouac's original manuscript, including some 200-odd dreams not published in the initial selection (1961). More or less liberated from the requirements of the Beat swagger, Kerouac's writing is at times blissfully uncool, evoking an almost na ve and sentimental sensibility: " this kitty was an angel, and spoke the truth"; "nobody loves me 'cause there's no me." Correspondences between some dream characters and their counterparts in the novels are not accidental, and are correlated in a prologue (and by poet Robert Creeley, in an insightful introduction). But many facets of Kerouac's oeuvre appear here much less polished, and more naked and powerful: " My mother and I are arm in arm on the floor, I'm crying afraid to die, she's blissful and has one leg in pink sexually out between me, and I'm thinking 'Even on the verge of death women think of love &amp; snaky affection' Women? who's dreaming this?" Lost love, madness, castration, cats that speak, cats in danger of their lives, people giving birth to cats, grade school classrooms, Mel Torme, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Tolstoy and Genet all make repeated appearances, lending the collection a repetitive, nonprogrammatic logic and exposing an unfamiliar sort of vulnerable beauty in Kerouac's iconic persona. One only wonders, in the end, whether anyone, even Jack Kerouac, really has such fantastic dreams.

Kwan&#x2019;s new principal, anticipating his depression and isolation, tells him about an internship at a genetics lab in Miami that&#x2019;s testing shark stem cells on rats in an effort to cure cancer and repair spinal injuries.

Drawing on extensive historical research, Eric Helleiner provides the first comprehensive political history of the phenomenon, one that details and explains the central role played by states in permitting and encouraging financial globalization.</p><p>Helleiner begins by highlighting the commitment of advanced industrial states to a restrictive international financial order at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference and during the early postwar years. He then explains the growing political support for the globalization of financial markets after the late 1950s by analyzing five sets of episodes: the creation of the Euromarket in the 1960s, the rejection in the early 1970s of proposals to reregulate global financial markets, four aborted initiatives in the late 1970s and early 1980s to implement effective controls on financial movements, the extensive liberalization of capital controls in the 1980s, and the containment of international financial crises at three critical junctures in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>He shows that these developments resulted from various factors, including the unique hegemonic interests of the United States and Britain in finance, a competitive deregulation dynamic, ideological shifts, and the construction of a crisis-prevention regime among leading central bankers. In his conclusion Helleiner addresses the question of why states have increasingly embraced an open, liberal international financial order in an era of considerable trade protectionism.</p></p><p><p>Eric Helleiner is CIGI Chair in International Governance and Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Waterloo. He is the author of The Making of National Money: Territorial Currencies in Historical Perspective and coeditor of Economic Nationalism in a Globalizing World, both from Cornell.</p><p>"Eric Helleiner offers readers a very useful and readable history of post-war changes in international finance. I would readily assign this book to graduate and advanced under-graduate seminars in international political economy. It covers a lot of territory and does not sacrifice depth for expanse."</p> (<i>International History Review</i>)<br><br><p>""This is a fascinating tale of how the international financial system arrived at its present global span. Helleiner argues that the liberalization of financial markets worldwide has been driven largely by government choices, not by technological change or economic pressures. The challenges to states and the reemergence of global finance reveal what an interesting and provocative book it is. This brief outline cannot do justice to its theoretical sophistication and historical depth. Helleiner has made an important contribution in a debate that will undoubtedly continue." &#x2015;International Journal"</p></p><h2>History Of Wisconsin: Volume I: From Exploration To Statehood (Volume 1)</h2><p>Published in 1973, this first volume in the <i>History of Wisconsin </i>series remains the definitive work on Wisconsin's beginnings, from the arrival of the French explorer Jean Nicolet in 1634, to the attainment of statehood in 1848.

After surviving multiple mass extinctions millions of years ago, mollusks and their shells still face an onslaught of anthropocentric challenges, including climate change and corrosive oceans. But rather than dwelling on all that is lost, Scales emphasizes that seashells offer an accessible way to reconnect people with nature, helping to bridge the gap between ourselves and the living world. <i>Spirals in Time</i> shows why nature matters, and reveals the hidden wonders that you can hold in the palm of your hand.</p></p><p><b>Helen Scales</b> is a marine biologist who has tagged sharks in California and studied the diverse fish that live on coral reefs in the South Pacific.

Cawelti Award</strong><br><br><strong>Archivists and Librarians in the History of the Health Sciences Award</strong><br><br>From Charles Atlas to Jane Fonda, the fitness movement has been a driving force in American culture for more than half a century. What started as a means of Cold War preparedness now sees 45 million Americans spend more than $20 billion a year on gym memberships, running shoes, and other fitness-related products. <br><br>In this first book on the modern history of exercise in America, Shelly McKenzie chronicles the governmental, scientific, commercial, and cultural forces that united&#x2014;sometimes unintentionally&#x2014;to make exercise an all-American habit. She tracks the development of a new industry that gentrified exercise and made the pursuit of fitness the hallmark of a middle-class lifestyle. Along the way she scrutinizes a number of widely held beliefs about Americans and their exercise routines, such as the link between diet and exercise and the importance of workplace fitness programs. <br><br>While Americans have always been keen on cultivating health and fitness, before the 1950s people who were preoccupied with their health or physique were often suspected of being homosexual or simply odd. As McKenzie reveals, it took a national panic about children's health to galvanize the populace and launch President Eisenhower's Council on Youth Fitness. She traces this newborn era through TV trailblazer Jack La Lanne's popularization of fitness in the '60s, the jogging craze of the '70s, and the transformation of the fitness movement in the '80s, when the emphasis shifted from the individual act of running to the shared health-club experience. She also considers the new popularity of yoga and Pilates, reflecting today's emphasis on leanness and flexibility in body image. <br><br>In providing the first real cultural history of the fitness movement, McKenzie goes beyond simply recounting exercise trends to reveal what these choices say about the people who embrace them. Her examination also encompasses battles over food politics, nutrition problems like our current obesity epidemic, and people left behind by the fitness movement because they are too poor to afford gym memberships or basic equipment. <br><br>In a country where most of us claim to be regular exercisers, McKenzie's study challenges us to look at why we exercise&#x2014;or at least why we think we should&#x2014;and shows how fitness has become a vitally important part of our American identity.</p><p>Shelly McKenzie, an independent scholar, holds a Ph. D. from George Washington University, where she has taught writing and American studies."In McKenzie&#x2019;s account, it was the lifestyle of suburban consumerism that both encouraged fitness and produced the medical need for it. . . . [Goes] a long way toward helping us make sense of what it means to be &#x201c;fit&#x201d; in America while complicating the place of physical fitness within our culture of body surveillance and rigid beauty standards."&#x2014;<i><b>American Studies</b></i><p>"A compelling, cohesive, and easy to follow account of the evolution of fitness culture in the United States."&#x2014;<b><i>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i></b></p><p>"Early twenty-first century conceptions of physical fitness are often assumed to be scientific truths . . .

The fitness culture that we assume to be an integral part of what it means to be American in the 21st century turns out to be a response to the mass flight from the urban environment to the car culture of the suburbs.

The Boers proved to be formidable opponents, masterfully compensating for inferior numbers with grim determination, resourcefulness and strong religious faith. Their mobility, expert use of cover, and knowledge of the terrain, in which they employed powerful long-range magazine rifles, gave them initial advantages. By contrast the British suffered from inadequate transport, insufficient mounted troops and poor intelligence.

The dialogue The Nature of the Gods both explores his own views on these subjects, as a monotheist and member of the Academic School, and considers the opinion of other philosophical schools of the Hellenistic age through the figures of Velleius the Epicurean and Balbus the Stoic. Eloquent, clearly argued and surprisingly modern, it focuses upon a series of fundamental religious questions including: is there a God? If so, does he answer prayers, or intervene in human affairs? Does he know the future? Does morality need the support of religion? Profoundly influential on later thinkers, such as Saint Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, this is a fascinating consideration of fundamental issues of faith and philosophical thought.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

By 70 BC he had established himself as the leading barrister in Rome, and was elected praetor in the year 66. Obtaining honours usually reserved for members of the aristocracy, Cicero was an uncompromising politician, and the greatest Roman orator. Horace C. P. McGregor graduated from Brasenose College, Oxford, in classics and philosophy. He entered the Home Office where he served until his retirement in 1967. He died in 1993. John M.

Subjected to grueling shifts and unreasonable standards&#x2015;a passenger missing his stop was a dismissible offense&#x2015;the so-called Pullmen of the country&#x2019;s rail lines were denied secure positions and prohibited from bringing their families to Canada, and it was their struggle against the racist Dominion that laid the groundwork for the multicultural nation we know today. Drawing on the experiences of these influential black Canadians, Cecil Foster&#x2019;s <i>They Call Me George </i>demonstrates the power of individuals and minority groups in the fight for social justice and shows how a country can change for the better.</p></p><p><p>Cecil Foster is a leading author, academic, journalist and public intellectual. His work speaks about the challenges that Black people have encountered historically in Canada in their efforts to achieve respect and recognition for their contribution to what is now a multicultural Canada. He highlights their fight for social justice and human dignity. In particular, Foster addresses the issues of immigration in his critical discussions on who is a Canadian in the ever-evolving social narrative toward a genuine multicultural Canada.</p><strong>Excerpt from <em>They Call Me George</em></strong> <p><em>Sitting in his condominium apartment in Halifax, Harold Adams is at ease with the life he has built for himself and his family and with most of the recent progress of his country. But this was not always the case. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how many times I came home and said I am not going back, this work is not for me,&#x201d; he says as he passes out a cup of tea, perhaps with the same care that he would have offered such service to a stranger over the 35 years of working as a porter on Canada national passenger railway. Now he sits in the apartment among some of the memorabilia that resulted from the long years of service and with fellow retired porter Thornton William and life-long friend Michael Tynes reminisce about life on the road and what has become of Canada. </em></p> <em> </em> <p><em>&#x201c;When we were growing up as kids we always saw the porters when they got in from a trip,&#x201d; recalls Tynes with a chuckle. &#x201c;They were the best dressed guys around, they drove the cars and they had the nicest homes.&#x201d; </em></p> <em> </em> <p><em>&#x201c;Well, not all porters had homes,&#x201d; Adams chides gently, reminding that life was not that kind and equal to everyone working as porters on the railways. &#x201c;But those that did, I used to think they were members of government, members of parliament, some official, &#x2019;cause we would always see them when they were dressed up and when they were leaving to go to work. But after they got to work, and after I got on the railway I learned that when they went to work they changed their clothes into a uniform, a white jacket with a collar that went around the neck, and I don&#x2019;t like to say it but some people refer to them as monkey hats, and you had to wear that when you were on the job. In those days, you&#x2019;d see very few Black people travelling in sleeping cars because it was too expensive; if they did travel the coach would be the best they could afford at that time. I am going back to the time when I first got onto the train like it was CNR then... After they made it VIA Rail.&#x201d; </em></p> <em> </em> <p><em>Williams too remembers seeing the porters around town. &#x201c;There was this fellow that I didn&#x2019;t quite know what he did. His name was Walter. I would see Walter around town and Walter was always well dressed and always had a little brief case with him and I kept thinking he was a lawyer. And it wasn&#x2019;t until years later that I got to realize he was porter.&#x201d; </em></p> <em> </em> <p><em>Adams signed on to work on the passenger service for Canadian National railway in 1962. He found that when travelling away from home he would stay in private homes as was the case in Montreal where as many as 16 porters might share the bunk beds in the same room on the second floor of a home. &#x201c;When I first went there, only Blacks stayed there but whites did not. When I first got there that was the way the porters lived. Whites working on the trains were waiters, stewards, conductors and cooks and they stayed elsewhere.&#x201d; Segregation of Black and white workers was prevalent. &#x201c;In Canada segregation existed all over. Even with government jobs, there were very few Blacks until around the 60s or late 50s, when Blacks started to get into the dockyards, but even when they did it was like porters....The reputations of us Blacks in general was that we were supposed to be good singers, good cooks, and good cleaners. And that existed in all Canada.&#x201d; </em></p> <em> </em> <p><em>Over a generation, these retirees have witnessed life changing somewhat for Black people in Canada. There are now more job opportunities available to Black Canadians, not like when they were teenagers. &#x201c;In the days prior to us, Nova Scotia like other places in Canada was very prejudice jobwise,&#x201d; Adams recalls. &#x201c;We had men that went to high school and the best thing they could get, the best job they could get was working on the train. And Blacks in general, especially men, we got spread across Canada mostly from Nova Scotia. What they would do to recruit was to come down to Halifax, down in the valley the small places, and anybody that wanted to work and was capable of making beds, it wasn&#x2019;t in those days hard work, but they took them and sent right across to Vancouver. In those days, there were very few Blacks living in upper Canada, like Calgary and Winnipeg and those places. They would take them across to live.&#x201d; </em></p> <em> </em> <p><em>The recruiters would also visit the British colonies in the Caribbean in search of porters for the railways and seamen for Canadian ships&#x2014;oftentimes the recruits working on both the rails and ships. Elombe Mottley, son of a popular politician in Barbados in the first half of last century recalls in an interview: &#x201c;When my father was growing up, even when I was a boy going to school in the late 1940s, you could always tell who was a seaman because his children always wore a gold plated watch, cause to own a watch in those days was a big thing.&#x201d; One particular porter was popular in those days for his community mindedness, a man with the nickname Zephyr who coached boxing to the boys. When came the time for Mottley to plan for the rest of his life, he came to Canada to study medicine at the University of Manitoba in 1958, arriving in Canada knowing that like so many West Indian students before him he could supplement his income and get to see the rest of North America by working summers and winters as a sleeping car porter. Eventually Mottley decided to return to the Caribbean. </em></p> <em> </em> <p><em>Canada became a confederation in 1867 and its history since then can be measured in how successful men like Adams, Williams and Tynes were able to make homes for themselves and their families in this country. Theirs is part of the story of a struggle to change Canada and to make it a place where Black boys and girls could grow up knowing that they have freedom of opportunity to become full fledged Canadians. This then is a story of the struggle for the recognition of dignity and for citizenship. </em></p> <p>Let&#x2019;s presume that in this country we are all fully human, something that wasn&#x2019;t always a given for people with Black skins or African ancestry. As a meaningful description, then, our greatest characteristic is our dignity: it&#x2019;s the basis on which we act out the bond we call citizenship. As a basic building block for our social interactions, dignity is what we all have in common, what in our human diversity makes us all equal. As citizens of this specific country, we recognize all fellow members as possessing this dignity, of agreeing to common and preferred ways of collectively acting out our basic humanity in solidarity and fraternity. What make us unique as a nation-state is the particular ways we recognize a common dignity in every member, how we celebrate our unique humanness in a way that makes our country and the way nationals live unique. What makes Canada unique, for example, is that it is supposedly a place&#x2014;an oasis as it were carved out of the rest of the world&#x2014;with its peculiar practices of recognizing the dignity inherent in all citizens. This is the vaunted Canadian way.</p> <p>Dignity does not reveal itself in any specific form, neither does it take any specific colour or hue; it is common across all races and ethnicities, religions and creeds, across all nationalisms, social categorizations and the lack thereof. Indistinguishable, it just exists and can be seen on the face of every human, in the way they walk, talk, play or perform any task, in the way they demand to be treated and how they treat others. Dignity is something that we can never lose, not even when incapacitated, and still be human; indeed, anyone having this dignity must de facto be human, it comes simply with possessing the human form; even the human dead is deemed to still have dignity as so many soldiers charged with war crimes have learned the hard way, or civilians going around desecrating graves and headstones. Dignity cannot be bought or sold, and its supply is not controlled by the vagaries of markets, the wealth of individuals or any other social categorization that determines statures and usefulness in any society. For in its indeterminacy dignity exists before the state intervenes and establishes social functions and the norms that go with them, before the collective or dominant will in the state starts divvying out inequalities. Dignity is a given, even if a society&#x2019;s recognition of it in its members is more deliberate&#x2014;often enunciated in laws, bills and charters of rights, regulations, codes, policies and practices&#x2014;all determined decisions of how to treat one another in a dignified way that is so common it produces a particular culture. Ironically, dignity can only be meaningful in a society.</p> <p>So if we cannot feel, taste, see, smell or hear dignity, if we cannot use our senses of description to know it, how can we claim dignity as the basis for human equality? Perhaps, we are asking the wrong question&#x2014;and perhaps we err by relying on signs and symbols analogously to help us to understand something, like an assumed human nature itself, that is unquantifiable. What if we see this dignity as a social convention, a moral belief based on the idea that as human beings we have the right and ability equally to make ourselves better, and in seeking this social perfection to do so in concert with others who share the same attributes and characteristic that is dignity? Freedom, or not to be held mentally or physically in bondage or forced compulsion, seems to capture much of what we imagine dignity entails. Dignity and freedom, as ill defined conceptually as they are, bring specific expectations to mind as we think of how we would expect to be treated by others and supposedly how we should treat them. Ethically dignity would be written into our rules of engagement with one another and would govern our expectations. Citizenship would be the expression of dignity. Dignity is about existence&#x2014;to be is to have it, freedom and citizenship are its vehicles. It is about acting in good faith.</p> <p>In keeping with the latter thinking we would be shifting the conversation from decoding signs and symbols&#x2014;such as relying on the physicality of the color of the skin, the height of the person, the differences in genitals, the language spoken&#x2014;of dignity as an intangible, as an indication of a relationship between human beings who might be different in as many ways physical as they are people, but as a measurement of the bond resulting from acts of volition for sharing the same intentions and goals. Therefore, whether they are physically or ontologically equal at the beginning of the relationship is not the question of concern, but rather once they are in a relationship our worry would be whether they are treated with the same touch agreeable as common to all participants. In this respect, dignity makes us all relations, social relatives bound together in a fraternal affiliation the strength of which is the expression and actions that flow from the recognition that other fellow travellers are following the same moral and ethical commands and are bound to the same expectations. We would then be all like passengers on a train heading generally in the same direction even if specifically we board and exist at different stops, perhaps some of us even ending up at the final stop or terminus, the farthest point the train would take us.</p> <p>What I have just described is the challenge undertaken by a group of people in the early part of the last century. They were attempting to shift the perception of fellow residents in their social world from one based exclusively on signs and symbols&#x2014;from description&#x2014;to one based on relationship among people who could be deemed to be morally entitled because of their relationship, in this case, in the exercise of nation building. The result of this attempted shift is the creation in the northernmost tip of North America, as part of an overall Western Hemisphere experience, of a country that is idealistically based not on what people look like or how they can be described physically or biologically, not even about what they do privately, but on what they share. Morally and ethically we are talking about how in fellowship people agree to treat one another, and in practice how faithful they are in keeping this agreement.</p> <p>Such is the story of Canada and of the largely social outcasts, described as Black sleeping car porters, and how these workers were in the vanguard for the creation of a new and modern Canada that now presents itself to the world as a paragon of harmoniously human relations&#x2014;a country that transformed itself from descriptively a White Man&#x2019;s country into relationally a multicultural one, to where every Canadian is supposedly treated with human dignity presumably held in equal proportions. This is the story of how these porters came into their own as a social and political force in a very special moment in time&#x2014;a story of how they changed Canada profoundly, setting it on a course that in good faith would make it idealistically a homeland for all forms of humanity.</p></p><h2>History of Philosophy, Vol. 11: Logical Positivism and Existentialism</h2><p>Copleston, an Oxford Jesuit and specialist in the history of philosophy, first created his history as an introduction for Catholic ecclesiastical seminaries.

Are you feeling lucky,&nbsp;believer?</p><p>Like the majority of ordinary British citizens, I used to be a good old&#x2013;fashioned atheist, secure in my conviction that folks who believed&#x2014;in angels and demons, supernatural manifestations and demiurges, snake-fondling and babbling in tongues and the world being only a few thousand years old&#x2014;were all superstitious idiots. It was a conviction encouraged by every crazy news item from the Middle East, every ludicrous White House prayer breakfast on the TV. But then I was recruited by the Laundry, and learned&nbsp;better.</p><p>I wish I could go back to the comforting certainties of atheism; it's so much less unpleasant than the One True&nbsp;Religion.</p><p>The truth won't make your Baby Jesus cry because, sad to say, there ain't no such Son of God. Moses may have taken two tablets before breakfast, but there was nobody home to listen to the prayers of the victims of the Shoah. The guardians of the Ka'abah have got the world's best tourism racket running, the Dalai Lama isn't anybody's reincarnation, Zeus is out to lunch, and you <i>really</i> don't want me to start on the&nbsp;neo-pagans.</p><p>However, there is a God out there&#x2014;vast and ancient and infinitely powerful&#x2014;and I know the name of this God. I know the path you have to walk down to be one with this God. I know his secret rituals and the correct form of prayer and his portents and signs. I have studied the ancient writings of his prophets and followers in person, not simply relying on the classified digests in the CODICIL BLACK SKULL files and the background briefings for CASE NIGHTMARE&nbsp;GREEN.</p><p>I'm a believer. And like I said, I wish I was still an atheist. Believing I was born into a harsh, uncaring cosmos&#x2014;in which my existence was a random roll of the dice and I was destined to die and rot and then be gone forever&#x2014;was infinitely more comforting than the&nbsp;truth.</p><p>Because the truth is that my God is coming&nbsp;back.</p><p>When he arrives I'll be waiting for him with a&nbsp;shotgun.</p><p>And I'm keeping the last shell for&nbsp;myself.</p><p>A couple of years ago, Angleton suggested I start writing my memoirs. It seemed a pretty weird idea at the time&#x2014;a thirty-year-old occult intelligence officer should take time off on the job to work on his autobiography?&#x2014;but he had a point. "Bob," he said, in his usual frighteningly avuncular tones, with a voice like dry sheets of parchment rubbing, "like it or not, that thick little skull of yours contains valuable institutional knowledge that has been acquired over years of service for H. M. Government. If you don't start now, you may never catch up with the job. And if you don't catch up with the job, part of the Laundry's institutional memory might vanish for good." He gave a curious little chuckle, as if he regretted having had to admit that there was any value to my meager contribution. "You might die on your next field assignment, or be turned by the enemy. And that'd be nearly ten years of work down the&nbsp;drain."</p><p>Then he pointed me at the rule book that explained how all officers above OC2 rank are required to either keep a classified journal or to periodically update their memoirs, which would be stored under lock and key&#x2014;automatically classified under the various keywords they'd been cleared for during the time period covered&#x2014;the books to be opened only in event of their author's death, retirement, or permanent disablement in the line of&nbsp;duty.</p><p>You know something? I <i>hate</i> writing. I keep having to distract myself, hence all the little jokes. It's actually not as if the job is all that funny, when you get down to it. Especially as I have to write everything either in longhand or on a 1962 Triumph Adler 66 manual typewriter, and burn the ribbons and carbon papers afterwards in the Security Office incinerator in front of two witnesses with high security clearances. I'm not allowed to use rubber bands or paper clips to hold the papers together (although string and, ye horrors, traditional red sealing wax&#x2014;and <i>don't</i> get me started on how difficult it is to melt the stuff in a smoke&#x2013;free building with fire detectors in every office&#x2014;is permitted). My fingers are hardwired for the Emacs programmers' editor and a laptop; this historic office re&#x2013;enactment stuff gets old real fast. But I&nbsp;digress.</p><p>This is the story of how I lost my atheism, and why I wish I could regain it. This is the story of the people who lost their lives in an alien desert bathed by the hideous radiance of a dead sun, and the love that was lost and the terror that wakes me up in a cold sweat about once a week, clawing at the sheets with cramping fingers and drool on my chin. It's why Mo and I aren't living together right now, why my right arm doesn't work properly, and I'm toiling late into the night, trying to bury the smoking wreckage of my life beneath a heap of&nbsp;work.</p><p>It's the story of what happened to the Fuller Memorandum, and the beginning of the end of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Are you sure you want to carry&nbsp;on?</p></p><h2>This Land Is Their Land: Reports from a Divided Nation</h2><p><p><b>America in the 'aughts&#x2015;hilariously skewered, brilliantly dissected, and darkly diagnosed by one of the country's most prominent social critics</b> </p><p>Now in paperback, Barbara Ehrenreich's widely acclaimed <i>This Land Is Their Land</i> takes the measure of what we are left with after the cruelest decade in memory and finds lurid extremes all around.

We hadn&#x2019;t had an enemy scary enough to pull us together since the USSR deconstructed in 1991, and now here was one capable of bringing down the World Trade Center with box cutters, a group that had declared they wanted every one of us dead, from the janitors in our buildings to the CEOs. Transfixed by the jihadists, we wrapped ourselves in flags&#x2014;flag sweaters, T-shirts, decals, lapel pins, even underwear and bathing suits. "United We Stand," proclaimed the bumper stickers, and "These Colors Don&#x2019;t Run."<p></p>To be sure, this unity was as thin as a starlet after a sojourn at a spa. How were we to express it, for example, other than through our sartorial decisions? We pondered the ubiquitous instruction to "report all and activities" and that even more enigmatic command from the New York mass transit system: "See something, say something." The president advised us to carry on shopping, which we did to the best of our abilities, remaining in a state of dazed puzzlement while the TSA stripped off our shoes and our belts and the government ripped away habeas corpus and all the elementary ingredients of privacy.<p></p>But whatever resonated with us about the idea of a "homeland" and "one nation, indivisible" was being quietly undercut by a force more powerful than terrorism, more divisive than treason. In a process that had begun in the 1980s and suddenly accelerated in the early 2000s, the ground was shifting under our feet, recarving the American landscape. The peaks of great wealth grew higher, rising up beyond the clouds, while the valleys of poverty sank lower into perpetual shadow. The once broad plateau of the middle class eroded away into a narrow ledge, with the white-knuckled occupants holding on for dear life.<p></p>It wasn&#x2019;t just a "shift," of course, governed by impersonal geological forces. The rude hand of human intervention could be felt in 2001, when the government gave the airlines a $20 billion post-9/11 bail-out, with nothing for the ninety thousand freshly laid-off airline employees. In another deft upward redistribution of wealth, the administration cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans while cutting back on services and programs, such as financial aid, for everyone else. We had never had a gang in Washington as noisily committed to "Christian values," and yet they had managed to stand core biblical teachings on their head.<p></p>The results were glaringly visible by 2004, when the Democratic vice presidential candidate announced there were now "two Americas." This was almost certainly an undercount. We had divided into two markets&#x2014;upscale and downscale, Sears and Saks&#x2014;two decades earlier, and now these were further subdividing. The middle class, battered by wave after wave of outsourcings and layoffs, scrambled to meet the ever-rising costs of health care, fuel, and college education. The traditional working class, already savaged by deindustrialization, took the low-paying service jobs that were left, trading their hard hats for mops and trays. They crowded grown children and grandchildren into their homes, which they refinanced at usurious rates. They faced speedups at work and cutbacks in pay. When their monthly health insurance premiums exceeded the mortgage or rent, they abandoned the insurance and fell back on Advil.<p></p>As for the rich, mere millionaires and the old-money sorts who favor weather-beaten summer homes in Nantucket barely qualified anymore. The upper class split into the merely affluent, who shop at Williams-Sonoma, and the �berrich, who had others do their shopping for them, as well as their child raising, bill paying, servant supervising, and party throwing. At the pinnacles of the wealth scale, extravagance reigned on a scale not seen since the late Roman Empire. Freshly fattened CEOs, hedge fund operators, and financiers hired interior decorators for their private jets, slugged back $10,000 martinis at the Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan, and, in one case, staged a $2 million birthday party in Sardinia featuring an ice statue of David urinating vodka.<p></p>There was a connection, as most people suspected, between the massive buildup of wealth among the few and the anxiety and desperation of the many. The money that fueled the explosion of gluttony at the top had to come from somewhere or, more specifically, from someone. Since no domestic oil deposits had been discovered, no new seams of uranium or gold, and since the war in Iraq enriched only the military contractors and suppliers, it had to have come from other Americans. In fact, the greatest capitalist innovations of this past decade have been in the realm of squeezing money out of those who have little to spare: taking away workers&#x2019; pensions and benefits to swell profits, offering easy credit on dubious terms, raising insurance premiums and refusing to insure those who might ever make a claim, downsizing workforces to boost share prices, even falsifying time records to avoid paying overtime.<p></p>Prosperity, in America, had not always been a zero-sum game. Early twentieth-century capitalists&#x2014;who were certainly no saints&#x2014;envisioned a prosperous people generating profits for the upper class by buying houses and cars and washing machines. But somewhere along the line, the ethos changed from we&#x2019;re all in this together to get what you can while the getting is good. Let the environment decay, the infrastructure crumble, the public hospitals close, the schools get by on bake sales, the workers drop from exhaustion&#x2014;who cares? Raise the premiums, reduce the wages, add new mystery fees to each bill, and let the devil take the hindmost. Only when the poor suckers at the bottom stopped buying and defaulted on their mortgages did anyone notice them.<p></p>And where were the rest of us during this orgy of accumulation at the top? What were we thinking as the "invisible hand" of the market reached into our pockets for our wallets? The truth is that most of us were too focused on the tasks at hand to pay much attention to what was going on with the neighbors. We were paying the bills, holding on to the job, occasionally making contact with the children. And when we did take a moment to tune into the public discourse, we heard very little that addressed our frustration and pain.<p></p>The war with Iraq, for starters, which had to be one of the greatest non sequiturs in military history. Attacked by a gang composed largely of Islamic militants from Saudi Arabia, the United States countered by invading an unrelated country, and one of the most secular in the Middle East at that. Briefly fascinated by the toppling of statues and flattening of towns, we rallied to "support our troops," although no one could figure out what we were supporting them to do. If the war had been launched as a distraction from the corporate scandals of 2002, as one theory goes, it soon became something we needed distraction from. Five years later, and after the hideous revelations of Abu Ghraib, we&#x2019;ve spent $505 billion, lost four thousand American lives, and achieved the status of a pariah among nations.<p></p>Issues more appropriate to a middle school biology or sex ed class also loomed large. Stem cells, for example: whole political careers were based on the defense of these wee entities and their slightly larger cousins the embryos. Insentient forms of life, such as a woman in a vegetative state, excited loud indignation, while the intact and living received barely a nod. In 2005, top Republicans rushed to the bedside of Terri Schiavo, bypassing the thousands of other ailing Floridians hit by Medicaid cuts. Gay marriage was another unlikely issue seemingly designed to distract us from the ongoing economic looting. How one person&#x2019;s marriage could threaten another&#x2019;s is a mystery to me, but whole elections were tipped in favor of the party of wealth, for no other purpose than to spare the public from the spectacle of same-sex embraces at the altar. As for the unmarried of any sexual orientation, abstinence was strongly recommended, along with prayer and cold showers.<p></p>Illegal immigrants are our latest distraction, vilified as if they had come to run drugs and collect welfare rather than mow lawns, clean offices, pack meat, and process poultry. There is no welfare anymore, of course, and that may be what makes the immigrants such an appealing target. Twenty years ago, right-wing demagogues had welfare recipients to kick around as a stand-in for the hated poor; today, immigrant workers have been pressed into playing the scapegoat role. The strategy is the same: to peel off some segment of the poorer classes, label them as enemies, and try to whip up rage that might have been directed at the economic over class. There may be reasonable arguments for limiting immigration, but it wasn&#x2019;t a Mexican who took away your pension or sold you on a dodgy mortgage.<p></p>Maybe, too, our critical faculties were dimmed by the habit, endemic in the early 2000s, of magical thinking. The biggest self-help best seller of the last year tells you how you can have anything you want, simply by willing it, and the fiction side of the bookstore is ruled by a young magician in training. Girls are forsaking feminism for a princess fantasy that culminates in weddings lavish enough to bankrupt a couple before they can even take out a car loan. Karl Rove derided the press for its membership in the "reality-based community," and the fastest-growing brand of religion is of the magical "name it and claim it" variety, in which the deity exists only to meet one&#x2019;s immediate, self-identified needs. It would be shortsighted to whine about rising debts and falling incomes when, with a little spiritual effort, the miraculous could happen to you.<p></p>How many "wake-up calls" do we need, people&#x2014;how many broken levees, drowned cities, depleted food pantries, people dead for lack of ordinary health care? We approach the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century in a bleak landscape cluttered with boarded-up homes and littered with broken dreams. The presidential candidates talk about "change," but don&#x2019;t bother to articulate what kind of change. Why don&#x2019;t we dare say it? The looting of America has gone on too long, and the average American is too maxed out, overworked, and overspent to have anything left to take. We&#x2019;ll need a new deal, a new distribution of power and wealth, if we want to restore the beautiful idea that was "America."<p></p>We could let the nation continue to fall apart, of course&#x2014; dividing ever more clearly into the gated communities on the one hand and trailer parks and tenements on the other&#x2014; until we eventually become one of those areas of the world prefixed by the mournful word former.<p></p>But I like to think we could find in our hearts some true ground for unity, some awareness of a common condition and collective aspiration. Maybe we could find it in an effort to restore America&#x2019;s lost glory&#x2014;the beauty of our land before all the fences and sprawl, the respect we once enjoyed from people around the world. Or maybe we need to find it in the common threats we face, not only from the human enemies that our foreign policy has been breeding so prolifically but from the global challenge of climate change and shrinking supplies of water and oil. And maybe, someday, we would even regain the confidence to extend that sense of unity and connectedness to all of our fellow human beings, wherever they may reside on the planet.<p></p>Excepted from This Land Is Their Land by Barbara Enrenreich<p></p>Copyright @ 2008 by Barbara Enrenreich<p></p>Published in 2008 by Henry Holt and Company, LLC<p></p>All rights reserved.

As one of the novels suggests, to be alive is not the same thing as being merely alive, in the same way that to have eyes is not the same thing as to see, and to have a mind is not the same thing as to understand.&#34;</p><h2>The Last Vispo Anthology: Visual Poetry 1998-2008</h2><p>The Last Vispo Anthology (a portmanteau of the words &#34;visual&#34; and &#34;poetry) spans from 1998 to 2008, during a burst of creative activity fueled by file sharing and e-mail.

Taking up the importance of 221B Baker Street to Sherlock Holmes, and of Bag-End to the hobbits who called it home, the book also sheds fresh light on Emily Bront�&#x2019;s <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, Mervyn Peake&#x2019;s <i>Gormenghast</i>, and the real-life settings of Daphne du Maurier&#x2019;s <i>Rebecca </i>and E. M. Forster&#x2019;s <i>Howards End</i>. Throughout, the book invites us to consider how houses, while so fundamental to these stories, also reveal much about their authors&#x2019; passions and preoccupations. A winning combination of literary criticism, geography, and biography, this is an entertaining and insightful celebration of beloved novels and the extraordinary role that houses play&#x2014;whether grand or small, unique or ordinary, real or imagined.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Christina Hardyment</b> is a writer and journalist with a special interest in literary geography and domestic history.

In Georgia, Alabama, and Florida they manifested a geographical and cultural, but not a political, cohesiveness. Ethnically and linguistically, they were highly diverse. This book is the first to locate them firmly in their full historical context.</p><p>J. Leitch Wright, Jr., was a professor of history at Florida State University and the author of such books as <i>The Only Land They Knew: The Tragic Story of The American Indians in the Old South</i> (1981).&#34;This last work by J. Leitch Wright, Jr., is fascinating, fine scholarship and a significant contribution to native American historiography... The author&#39;s &#39;ethnicity&#39; argument provides an interesting alternative analysis of the course of Creek and Seminole history. Well stated and supported, it should excite students and scholars of southeastern Indian culture.&#34;-Robert L. Gold, American Historical Review -- Robert L. Gold American Historical Review &#34;This book gives a fresh perspective on how the Creeks and Seminoles endured the test of Indian-white relations...

Fixico, Journal of American History -- Donald L.

At no point during the entire&nbsp;three&nbsp;weeks&nbsp;were the pair separated by more than 53 seconds, a razor thin margin between ultimate triumph or agonizing torment.

They cut through the back panel, glass, and my flesh with the ease you&#x2019;d expect of steel-jacketed high-velocity rounds.</p><p>I would draw my last breath on the traditional human holiday of Halloween, having seen forty-two years. The Kentucky soil of the Ohio Basin would absorb my blood, and I would join my mate, our children, and the ancestors after a brief period of suffering.</p><p>I have been told to begin this account in medias res. Were it up to me, I would open this memoir with a brief account of my background as a Xeno, a species foreign to this earth, yet born here nevertheless, and, as I noted, the first of my family born on our new homeworld. I would name myself the son of a people lied into war and rewarded for their losses with poisoned land and broken treaties.</p><p>I&#x2019;m told I came into life in the year 2031 in the normal manner for a Golden One, letting out healthy yapping cries and covered in fine, translucent hair, born in the house of my father and uncles on the banks of the Missouri River, the old state designation of Nebraska. A prophecy of the stains of my birth said I would make my mark among men in strange lands. Some account of my early years as a trader and then later as a speaker for my people would explain my ability with English, the most common tongue of the humans of my region. My rise into the Golden Ones&#x2019; councils at a young age might give you some reason to accept the facility of my senses and judgment.</p><p>My scars in the war against the Kurian Order remain for all to see, even if they are faded and camouflaged by an old Grog&#x2019;s sags and wrinkles. The lies endured, the losses suffered by my people, including the murder of my beloved and our family, would explain my affiliation with our common cause, when this extraordinary world&#x2019;s even more extraordinary people rose and rid us of those who treated us as livestock.</p><p>We think, though I have reason to wonder. But that takes me beyond this narrative.</p><p>I would speak briefly of my meeting David Valentine, a man I am proud to call my seshance,* who found me wounded and revived me in body and spirit. I would conclude that sketch with a mention that our endeavors are chronicled elsewhere with the usual mild omissions and exaggerations that inevitably cloud reality when a biographer is asked to weave, telling the colorful oft-told tales and disclosing the sometimes-disappointing truth.</p><p>Without those particulars of my life, how is the reader to judge the value of this reminiscence? It would be like weighing the goose by extrapolation from a single feather.</p><p>But my publisher has requested that I begin with the night of the* friend-as-important- as-family wild flight across the Ohio River and into Kentucky, on Halloween night.</p><p>There were seven of us in that big black high-riding utility vehicle that crashed through the bridge barrier, fleeing like Eliza across the Ohio with a far worse master than Simon Legree behind, though southbound rather than north. We had escaped a no-longer- secret installation of the Kurian Order called Xanadu with a pregnant woman, a patient there who had once been married to my David&#x2019;s friend William Post. I was rearmost, filling the back of the truck, squatting uncomfortably on some tools, tow chains, and a spare battery.</p><p>A bag of groceries hastily thrown in as provision had spilled, so there were apples rolling back and forth on the floor as we took hard turns.</p><p>Our intention was to race into the Kentucky hills and lose ourselves among the legworm ranchers there. Kentucky was a wild land, thinly held by the Kurian Overlords even then, and the legworm ranchers enjoyed a measure of independence required by the needs of their voracious herds.</p><p>A spray of bullets from the surprised sentries ended that hope, at least for me. Three bullets and a piece of what I believe was glass struck me across the abdomen and neck. Worse, the pursuit started almost instantly, suggestive of expectation on our enemy&#x2019;s part. I suspected I would not last much longer in the chase, so I volunteered to take the wheel and lead the pursuit away from the others.</p><p>With an approaching column of Ohio vehicles filled with soldiers, I did not mention my injuries or the inevitable outcome of the chase. It was the sort of moment that would take an entire night to say what needed to be said.</p><p>We had to act while the pursuers were still far enough away not to notice a ruse, so at a thickly covered hillside I took the wheel from my David. My David has never had much confidence behind the wheel of such machines&#x2014;to this day he is an atrocious driver even if one allows for his bad eye. Though one of our party was a doctor and saw to it that my injuries would not immediately bleed me out, I would only slow them on a foot pursuit. Everyone saw the necessity of the action, and we parted with regret and brevity, though David took some convincing. Our farewells are not something I can remember without much emotion, and I will not slow this narrative with sentiments recorded elsewhere.*</p><p>Before squeezing behind the wheel, I took the precaution of putting some of the chains and locks and hitches in the forward passenger seat.</p><p>Determined to lead the Ohio forces on as merry a chase as possible so that my friends might escape safely, I pulled away. I avoided looking back at the trees where my friend of many years disappeared with his party, not unmoved by emotion or unwetted by tears.</p><p>I drove perhaps two more miles and then stopped at the other side of a tangled a crossroads ruin long enough to smash the taillights of the &#x201c;Lincoln&#x201d; (an odd moniker for so vast a vehicle, considering the former president&#x2019;s narrow frame and thin features).</p><p>The act was harder than you might think. Despite the bullet holes, the well-preserved vintage Lincoln was a beautiful piece of machinery. It offered an almost supernaturally smooth ride, yet transmitted a good feel up to the driver for what the tires were doing; it was also responsive, quick to accelerate or break. The on-board computer system automatically worked the power to the wheels and brakes in turns, making it more difficult to roll. You can literally say of such machines: they don&#x2019;t make &#x2019;em like they used to. The superb machine&#x2019;s performance was buying precious extra time for the escape of my friends, and I was grateful for it.</p><p>I failed to destroy one brake light, however, and I believe that proved to be my undoing. Or perhaps there was some kind of tracking device on the vehicle. Though I drove as fast as I dared, not using the vehicle&#x2019;s forward floodlights, I saw my pursuers closing, a remorseless snake of vehicles following the hare-trail</p><p>I was tearing through the overgrown Kentucky highway, grasses, shrubs,</p><p>and bits of branch clinging to my vehicle&#x2019;s grille and mirrors as though fighting to keep me from further destruction of the road&#x2019;s plant life.</p><p>My pursuers had large, high-clearance vehicles and, it seemed, a</p><p>better knowledge of the terrain. Twice I had hopes that I&#x2019;d lost them, only to see them coming at me from my quarter via a shortcut through the hills only they knew existed.</p><p>Only one gambit remained, it seemed; the one I had planned for when I placed the chains beside me. Most humans have a tendency to fill in blanks in their education with a set of less-reliable associations born of their own experiences and prejudices. Because we are larger than even the biggest men, until recently alien to their world, hairy, big-eared and sharp-toothed</p><p>in a manner similar to the Gray Grogs, most humans will assume my intelligence and understanding operate at the more rudimentary level of my distant relations, though we are as dissimilar in our mental abilities as man is to the chimpanzee. This category error has worked to my advantage before.</p><p>I drove a few more minutes until I saw my opportunity. A downed limb partially blocked the road bordered now on either side by forest. I swerved around the heavy limb and aimed the big four-wheel at a thick trunk. Though I braced myself for the impact, I can still feel the collision in my neck when I remember that night.</p><p>In my remaining moments I wound the chains around my seat and, with some fumbling, locked and hitched them behind me. Long arms and a dexterous set of feet have their advantages.</p><p>My pursuers deployed their vehicles as well as the trees and overgrown roadside allowed, using their doors as shields and rests for their weapons.</p><p>They shouted at me to show my hands out the window. Instead, I pounded on the still- functioning horn until they fanned out to one side to approach, boots crunching the fall leaves, carbines and shotguns held to their shoulders.</p><p>Of the possibilities for my immediate future, none looked particularly promising. A straightforward execution in the form of a bullet to some quarter of my head seemed the most likely, especially when they saw my wounds. I could meet death calmly, perhaps welcome it. Ever since the loss of my beloved, I have waited for death&#x2019;s misted portal to open, sometimes taking chances that might hasten it, for after a soul-purging tour of the hells I&#x2019;ve missed in this life, I&#x2019;m sure my soul would be judged worthy of ascension. And there, she would be waiting. We would set teeth to ear as we had at our pairing and never be parted again. I&#x2019;ve kept the honor of my father&#x2019;s name and labored for the betterment of my people and, I suspect, even made a difference in a human life or two. I&#x2019;m confident that&#x2019;s worth something when my acts are calculated and will avoid the humiliation of a reincarnation. At least I hope so.</p><p>The pain of my wounds waxed. Our vet had been fairly certain that my vitals were untouched, but that didn&#x2019;t stop the throbbing, warming sensation rapidly escalating into a burn. Enough pain, and you become resigned to your fate; your one hope is that it is over with quickly. I wasn&#x2019;t there yet, but I feared I soon would be.</p><p>An early death would be a kindness. My beloved hates to be kept waiting. Nothing in this patch of Kentucky woods would mark my death, save for a scar the roadside tree would bear for the rest of its life. Maybe someday my David would piece it together; I could rely on him to place a small memorial.</p><p>&#x201c;I told you it was riding higher,&#x201d; were the first words I heard through something other than an amplifying speaker.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a Grog,&#x201d; another said.</p><p>I hit the horn again and offered blubbering noises. It was no stage performance for police-vehicle limelight. The grief over the damage to the Lincoln was very real.</p><p>The next thing I knew, the barrel of a pistol was pointed at my head from over the rearview mirror. I could follow the foresight back to a steady eye, glinting in the darkness. What looked like lieutenant bars were stitched onto his collar, gray against black. He&#x2019;d crept up as silently as my David, though my blasts on the horn had helped.</p><p>More men came around the front, and powerful flashlight beams lanced into my eyes. I gave a very real whimper and a pained yip.</p><p>&#x201c;Yo!&#x201d; the lieutenant said. &#x201c;They got him chained in the driver&#x2019;s seat. That&#x2019;s why he didn&#x2019;t run. Get a bomb-dog up here, now!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep those hands up,&#x201d; a voice ordered. I&#x2019;d been trying to shield my eyes from the flashlights with my forearm.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, Corp, it&#x2019;d be just like those bastards to blow up some poor dumb Grog to try to get us,&#x201d; another, younger voice said.</p><p>Not just one dog came forward, but three. After the first, a good-natured yellow pot roast of a birder sniffed around beneath the car and behind my seat, pausing with interest over my wounds; other yelping hounds smelled the upholstery and started running in and out of the surrounding woods, trying to locate a trail.</p><p>They removed my chains with bolt cutters and kept their guns</p><p>on me.</p><p>The lieutenant had an aged, battered face, but kindly eyes. He looked like the sort of man you&#x2019;d send into the brush after an escapee from a sensitive institution. I wondered what sin lay in his past, that the Kurian Order did not let him rise above his original commissioned rank.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s those guerillas for you,&#x201d; an Ohio backing up his lieutenant said. &#x201c;Take some poor dumb hurt animal and chain him behind a wheel. Fuckers. I bet they told him home and bed were just down the road. Poor dumb Grog.&#x201d;</p><p>Since they seemed in no hurry to effect my ticket for the hells I&#x2019;ve missed in this life, I fell out of the door and decided to vocalize. Maybe it would draw the hounds&#x2019; attention. Every minute counted. Eventually</p><p>they&#x2019;d backtrack, but if I could delay things here . . .</p><p>I lay on my face, hiking my butt up as though expecting a deserved kick, arms extended toward the lieutenant with the pistol.</p><p>&#x201c;Me drive. Me drive good,&#x201d; I gabbled. &#x201c;No go wrong way. No carelessnessish!</p><p>Not see tree beside road. Only see tree on road.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wow, this one&#x2019;s a regular J. Edger Proofcock,&#x201d; a soldier to my right said, with the youthful voice I&#x2019;d heard earlier. I looked at the front of the car and let out a wailing cry of horror.</p><p>&#x201c;You fix? Please you fix? Scrap, no, not scrap! Oh, oh, oh! Drive</p><p>good no!&#x201d; I finished, summoning the rest of this season&#x2019;s allotment of tears. I crawled for the wreck, patted the hood of the Lincoln,</p><p>threw myself against a tire under the hostile guns, weeping like bereft Niobe herself. Human culture is so rich in emotional exhibitions.</p><p>Not the Golden One way&#x2014;we only howl to frighten enemies&#x2014;but over a lifetime among men I&#x2019;ve now learned to appreciate the benefit of a good teary purge.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s worried we&#x2019;ll shitcan him for wrecking that Xanadu ride,&#x201d; the man with the bolt cutters said. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t know guerillas from churchmen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whaddya say, Lieutenant? End the laments?&#x201d; the man with the shotgun said, bringing it to his shoulder again.</p><p>Coming your way, beloved. Tell the children.</p><p>&#x201c;Top, hold up,&#x201d; the youthful-sounding one who&#x2019;d expressed sympathy for the poor dumb animal said. &#x201c;Let me take him. I can find a buyer in Lex. Ought to be worth a couple thou. Big healthy Grog like that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Healthy? You see he&#x2019;s bleeding, Frisky?&#x201d; bolt cutters said.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon.

Thirty percent for you, Lieutenant, twenty for the Top. I&#x2019;ll take him to Lexington with a pass and see what I can get for him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Forty percent for me,&#x201d; the lieutenant said.</p><p>&#x201c;And thirty for me,&#x201d; the shotgun-wielding Top added.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll take ten,&#x201d; the lieutenant said. &#x201c;Eager to please, muscles like that. And can drive, too. Ought to be worth four or five thou if he speaks and savvies and is intact below the belt.

The young Gordianus has been waiting out the chaos in Alexandria, with Bethesda, when he gets a cryptic message from his former tutor and friend, Antipater. Now in Ephesus, as part of Mithridates' entourage, Antipater seems to think that his life is in imminent danger. </p><p>To rescue him, Gordianus concocts a daring, even foolhardy, scheme to go "behind enemy lines" and bring Antipater to safety. But there are powerful, and deadly forces, at work here, which have their own plans for Gordianus.

Like many ideals, this one was freighted with many meanings. As the colony grew in the seventeenth century, the belief in religious liberty and freedom of conscience espoused by its founder, Roger Williams, led to the development of political liberty and practical democracy. In the eighteenth century, that dedication to individualism made Rhode Islanders into businessmen of the first order, willing to take the big risk in hope of a bigger reward. Their land being poor in natural resources, Rhode Islanders turned to trade; accumulating wealth from traffic in rum and slaves, they built in Newport and Providence small but elegant copies of Georgian England, and worried more about taxes and currency than about religion. When they felt poorly served by British policies, they became ready revolutionaries and led in the founding of a new nation. After the Civil War, their children took individual liberty to mean economic laissez-faire, ushering in the state's golden age when Rhode Island senator Nelson Aldrich became known as the "general manager" of the United States.<br><br> Through countless changes in the twentieth century, the ideal still survives and asks old questions of new generations of Rhode Islanders from many ethnic backgrounds: How best to reconcile the rights of minorities with the rule of the majority, and how best to secure the individual liberty and economic opportunity that Roger Williams and Moses Brown would have understood so well?</p><p>High atop the Rhode Island capitol in Providence, a bronze likeness of &#34;&#34;The Independent Man&#34;&#34; keeps watch over a state that historically has put the ideal of individual liberty before all others.

H. the Dalai Lama, draws from over fifty years of practicing and teaching this ancient tradition of healing. This volume vividly presents a series of lectures Dr. Dhonden gave before a group of health care professionals at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. This lecture series was presented during the planning stages of a research project at the University of California San Francisco to test Dr. Dhonden's medical treatment for metastatic breast cancer. (This research project caught the interest of NBC's <i>Dateline,</i> which filmed an hour-long documentary of it that aired in January 2000.) Dr. Dhonden elucidates the holistic Tibetan medical view of health and disease, referring to traditional Tibetan medical sources as well as his own experiences as a doctor practicing in Tibet India and numerous countries throughout Europe and America. His presentation is delightfully complemented by many anecdotes drawing from the ancient lore of popular folk medicine in Tibet. For health care professionals, anthropologists, historians of medicine, medical ethicists, and the general public interested in Tibetan medicine, this book is a fascinating contribution by one of the foremost practitioners of Tibetan medicine in the modern world.</p><p>Dr. Donden gives an introduction to the Tibetan medical system, its perspective on the body as well as the nature of illness, to Western medical practitioners. Chapters imclue the topics of: the digestive process, the humors, and the classification of disease. He goes on to discuss particular issues such as AIDS and cancer and finally how to improve one&#39;s lifestyle to encourage health. His discussions are particularly interesting because he brings his many years of personal experience into his presentation.Dr. Yeshe Dhonden was trained by the Venerable Dr. Khyenrab Norbu (1883&#x2013;1962), personal physician to Holinesses the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dalai Lamas and founder of the Men-Tsee-Khang and Tibetan Medical and Astrology Institute in Tibet.

Beginning with the creation of Earth out of Chaos, Vernant continues with the castration of Uranus, the war between the Titans and the Olympian gods, the wily ruses of Prometheus and Zeus, and the creation of Pandora, the first woman. His narrative takes readers from the Trojan War to the voyage of Odysseus, from the story of Dionysus to the terrible destiny of Oedipus, to Perseus's confrontation with the Gorgons.</p><p>Jean-Pierre Vernant has devoted himself to the study of Greek mythology. In recounting these tales, he unravels for us their multiple meanings and brings to life the beloved figures of legend whose narratives lie at the origin of our civilization.</p></p><p><p>Jean-Pierre Vernant is a professor at the Coll�ge de France in Paris and one of the foremost classicists of our time. He is the author of numerous scholarly books on Greek thought, myths, tragedy, politics, society, and religion.</p><p>Linda Asher, a former editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>, has translated into English many French language writers, including Nicolas Edme Restif de Ia Bretonne, Victor Hugo, Georges Simenon, and Milan Kundera.</p>Drawing on fond memories of regaling his grandson with "once upon a time" tales from Greek legend, acclaimed classicist Vernant recounts seven of these tales in a gentle, conversational style. Vernant takes a traditional approach as he explores the mythic foundations of the creation of the earth, the birth of the Titans, and the enduring momentum of human heritage. The casually arranged entries include readable accounts of Prometheus, Pandora, Odysseus, Dionysus, Oedipus, and other legendary figures whose narratives reveal a compelling path pertinent to our own civilization. Storytelling at its best, this brief anthology is approachable while remaining true to its sources. A rich treasury for all readers. Richard K.

This book has been written out of the conviction that Protestant churches need to reacquaint themselves with their rich doctrinal heritage, particularly their understanding of the gospel- the good news of free acceptance with God on the basis of Christ&#39;s redeeming work. Before abandoning the &#39;older perspective&#39; on Paul in favour of the new, evangelical Christians need to understand exactly what it is they are being asked to abandon. Furthermore, evangelicals must take a careful look at the claims of those who propose a newer and ostensibly &#39;better&#39; reading of the apostle&#39;s letters. The newer perspective on Paul makes bold claims for itself, some of which may be rather appealing in an age that favors change and has grown weary with the battle lines of ancient and bitter debates. The newer perspective on Paul demands careful study and assessment, for at stake is nothing less than the gospel itself. In this study the reader will find: A summary of the older perspective of the Reformation (which understood justification to be the gospel&#39;s declaration that sinners are acceptable to God by the grace of Christ alone) A general introduction to what is known as the &#39;new perspective&#39; on Paul A critical assessment of new perspective claims from both a biblical and a theological standpoint.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Leafy Greens Cookbook: 67 Leafy Greens and 250 Recipes</h2><p><p> <b><i>From the common to the somewhat obscure -- everyone is looking to incorporate more leafy greens into their diets.</i></b> </p><p> This comprehensive book is a reflection of the groundswell of enthusiasm there is out there for healthy eating -- leafy greens in particular.

Educated at Cambridge, she was a senior lecturer in English at University College London. She lives in London.<b>The Thing in the Forest<br></b><br>There were once two little girls who saw, or believed they saw, a thing in a forest. The two little girls were evacuees, who had been sent away from the city by train, with a large number of other children. They all had their names attached to their coats with safetypins, and they carried little bags or satchels, and the regulation gas-mask. They wore knitted scarves and bonnets or caps, and many had knitted gloves attached to long tapes which ran along their sleeves, inside their coats, and over their shoulders and out, so that they could leave their ten woollen fingers dangling, like a spare pair of hands, like a scarecrow. They all had bare legs and scuffed shoes and wrinkled socks. Most had wounds on their knees in varying stages of freshness and scabbiness. They were at the age when children fall often and their knees were unprotected. With their suitcases, some of which were almost too big to carry, and their other impedimenta, a doll, a toy car, a comic, they were like a disorderly dwarf regiment, stomping along the platform.<br><br>The two little girls had not met before, and made friends on the train. They shared a square of chocolate, and took alternate bites at an apple. One gave the other the inside page of her <i>Beano</i>. Their names were Penny and Primrose. Penny was thin and dark and taller, possibly older, than Primrose, who was plump and blonde and curly. Primrose had bitten nails, and a velvet collar to her dressy green coat. Penny had a bloodless transparent paleness, a touch of blue in her fine lips. Neither of them knew where they were going, nor how long the journey might take. They did not even know why they were going, since neither of their mothers had quite known how to explain the danger to them. How do you say to your child, I am sending you away, because enemy bombs may fall out of the sky, because the streets of the city may burn like forest fires of brick and timber, but I myself am staying here, in what I believe may be daily danger of burning, burying alive, gas, and ultimately perhaps a grey army rolling in on tanks over the suburbs, or sailing its submarines up our river, all guns blazing? So the mothers (who did not resemble each other at all) behaved alike, and explained nothing, it was easier. Their daughters they knew were little girls, who would not be able to understand or imagine.<br><br>The girls discussed on the train whether it was a sort of holiday or a sort of punishment, or a bit of both. Penny had read a book about Boy Scouts, but the children on the train did not appear to be Brownies or Wolf Cubs, only a mongrel battalion of the lost. Both little girls had the idea that these were all perhaps <i>not very good children</i>, possibly being sent away for that reason. They were pleased to be able to define each other as 'nice'. They would stick together, they agreed. Try to sit together, and things.<br><br>The train crawled sluggishly further and further away from the city and their homes. It was not a clean train - the upholstery of their carriage had the dank smell of unwashed trousers, and the gusts of hot steam rolling backwards past their windows were full of specks of flimsy ash, and sharp grit, and occasional fiery sparks that pricked face and fingers like hot needles if you opened the window. It was very noisy too, whenever it picked up a little speed. The engine gave great bellowing sighs, and the invisible wheels underneath clicked rhythmically and monotonously, tap-tap-tap-CRASH, tap-tap-tap-CRASH. The window-panes were both grimy and misted up. The train stopped frequently, and when it stopped, they used their gloves to wipe rounds, through which they peered out at flooded fields, furrowed hillsides and tiny stations whose names were carefully blacked out, whose platforms were empty of life.<br><br>The children did not know that the namelessness was meant to baffle or delude an invading army. They felt - they did not think it out, but somewhere inside them the idea sprouted - that the erasure was because of them, because they were not meant to know where they were going or, like Hansel and Gretel, to find the way back. They did not speak to each other of this anxiety, but began the kind of conversation children have about things they really disliked, things that upset, or disgusted, or frightened them. Semolina pudding with its grainy texture, mushy peas, fat on roast meat. Listening to the stairs and the window-sashes creaking in the dark or the wind. Having your head held roughly back over the basin to have your hair washed, with cold water running down inside your liberty bodice. Gangs in playgrounds. They felt the pressure of all the other alien children in all the other carriages as a potential gang. They shared another square of chocolate, and licked their fingers, and looked out at a great white goose flapping its wings beside an inky pond.<br><br>The sky grew dark grey and in the end the train halted. The children got out, and lined up in a crocodile, and were led to a mud-coloured bus. Penny and Primrose managed to get a seat together, although it was over the wheel, and both of them began to feel sick as the bus bumped along snaking country lanes, under whipping branches, dark leaves on dark wooden arms on a dark sky, with torn strips of thin cloud streaming across a full moon, visible occasionally between them.</p><h2>Giambattista Vico: Keys to the &#34;New Science&#34;: Translations, Commentaries, and Essays</h2><p><p><i>Giambattista Vico: Keys to the "New Science"</i> brings together in one volume translations, commentaries, and essays that illuminate the background of Giambattista Vico's major work. Thora Ilin Bayer and Donald Phillip Verene have collected a series of texts that help us to understand the progress of Vico's thinking, culminating in the definitive version of the <i>New Science</i>, which was published in 1744. </p><p>Bayer and Verene provide useful introductions both to the collection as a whole and to the individual writings. What emerges is a clear picture of the decades-long process through which Vico elaborated his revolutionary theory of history and culture. Of particular interest are the first sketch of the new science from his earlier work, the Universal Law, and Vico's response to the false book notice regarding the first version of his New Science. The volume also includes additions to the 1744 edition that Vico had written out but that do not appear in the English translations&#x2015;including his brief chapter on the "Reprehension of the Metaphysics of Descartes, Spinoza, and Locke"&#x2015;and a bibliography of all of Vico's writings that have appeared in English. <i>Giambattista Vico: Keys to the "New Science"</i> is a unique and vital companion for anyone reading or rereading this landmark of Western intellectual history.</p></p><p><p>Thora Ilin Bayer is RosaMary Foundation Professor of Liberal Arts at Xavier University of Louisiana.

This includes not only the crucial published work on universal law but also a manuscript fragment relating to it, Vico's reply to the early review of his 'new science,' additions to the second edition of work, his late conception of the classical muses, his 'tree of knowledge,' and his critique of Descartes, Spinoza, and Locke. All of these, not always available in the existing English translations, come with important and valuable interpretation, commentary, and a review of Vico's metaphysics. A complete bibliography of English-language translations of Vico's writings is appended. Vico's work is seldom, if ever, seen historically and as a whole.

He left Athens in 401 and joined an expedition including ten thousand Greeks led by the Persian governor Cyrus against the Persian king. After the defeat of Cyrus, it fell to Xenophon to lead the Greeks from the gates of Babylon back to the coast through inhospitable lands. Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this 'March Up-Country' (<i>Anabasis</i>); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth.</p><p>Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i> is a true story of remarkable adventures. <i>Hellenica,</i> a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In <i>Memorabilia</i> Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The <i>Apology</i> is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's <i>Symposium</i> portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and <i>Oeconomicus</i> has him giving advice on household management and married life. <i>Cyropaedia,</i> a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes.</p><p>We also have his <i>Hiero,</i> a dialogue on government; <i>Agesilaus,</i> in praise of that king; <i>Constitution of Lacedaemon</i> (on the Spartan system); <i>Ways and Means</i> (on the finances of Athens); <i>Manual for a Cavalry Commander;</i> a good manual of <i>Horsemanship;</i> and a lively <i>Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians,</i> though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.</p></p><p><p>Carleton Lewis Brownson (1866&#x2013;1948) was Professor of Classical Languages at the City College of New York.</p>&#34;In the future when the historian sifts through the debris of our era, oversaturated with information, once the dross has been cast aside, more than a few of the things that remain will be bound in the covers of The Edwin Mellen Press. - Charles S.

The current available texts are dated and suffer from a lack of familiarity with the manuscript tradition for this important work... The translators have rejected derivative manuscripts and concentrated on those that they have shown in previously published work to have been the critical witnesses.

It&nbsp;stretches across 190 miles from St Bees Head on the East coast to Robin Hood's Bay on the West, passing through the Lake District, Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors. This Readers Edition of&nbsp;Wainwrght's final&nbsp;Pictorial Guide, first published in 1973, has been freshly reproduced from&nbsp;Wainwright's original text, illustrations and beautifully&nbsp;hand-drawn black-and-white route maps.</p><p>Born in Blackburn in 1907, Alfred Wainwright left school at the age of 13. A holiday at the age of 23 kindled a life-long love affair with the Lake District. Following a move to Kendal in 1941 he began to devote every spare moment he had to researching and compiling the original seven Pictorial Guides. He described these as his &#39;love letters&#39; to the Lakeland Fells and at the end of the first, The Eastern Fells, he wrote about what the mountains had come to mean to him: &#34;I suppose it might be said, to add impressiveness to the whole thing, that this book has been twenty years in the making, for it is so long, and more, since I first came from a smoky mill-town (forgive me, Blackburn!) and beheld, from Orrest Head, a scene of great beauty, a fascinating paradise, Lakeland&#39;s mountains and trees and water. That was the first time I had looked upon beauty, or imagined it, even. Afterwards I went often, whenever I could, and always my eyes were lifted to the hills. I was to find then, and it has been so ever since, a spiritual and physical satisfaction in climbing mountains - and a tranquil mind upon reaching their summits, as though I had escaped from the disappointments and unkindnesses of life and emerged above them into a new world, a better world. In due course I came to live within sight of the hills, and I was well content. If I could not be climbing, I was happy to sit idly and dream of them, serenely. Then came a restlessness and the feeling that it was not enough to take their gifts and do nothing in return. I must dedicate something of myself, the best part of me, to them. I started to write about them, and to draw pictures of them. Doing these things, I found they were still giving and I still receiving, for a great pleasure filled me when I was so engaged - I had found a new way of escape to them and from all else less worth while. Thus it comes about that I have written this book. Not for material gain, welcome though that would be (you see I have not escaped entirely!); not for the benefit of my contemporaries, though if it brings them also to the hills I shall be well pleased; certainly not for posterity, about which I can work up no enthusiasm at all. No, this book has been written, carefully and with infinite patience, for my own pleasure and because it has seemed to bring the hills to my own fireside. If it has merit, it is because the hills have merit.&#34; A. Wainwright died in 1991 at the age of 84.&#34;No walker should be without a little bit of Wainwright while they&#39;re doing the walk.

There is always a tendency, on the part of his detractors, to make of Solzhenitsyn something less than he is, but here is further evidence that he is something more than even his admirers thought." - Clive James,<i> New Statesman </i></p><p><b>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</b> (1918-2008), winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature, was serving the Soviet Army in 1945 when he was arrested and sentenced to eight years in a labor camp, later cut short by Khrushchev's reforms. Although permitted to publish <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i>, Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Writers' Union in 1969. The Western publication of his other novels, particularly <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i>, brought retaliation: in 1974, Solzhenitsyn was stripped of his citizenship and forcibly flown to Frankfurt. In 1991, the Soviet government dismissed treason charges against him, and Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia in 1994.Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>Death in Hamburg: Society and Politics in the Cholera Years</h2><p>Why were nearly 10,000 people killed in six weeks in Hamburg, while most of Europe was left almost unscathed? As Richard J. Evans explains, it was largely because the town was a &#x201c;free city&#x201d; within Germany that was governed by the &#x201c;English&#x201d; ideals of laissez-faire. The absence of an effective public-health policy combined with ill-founded medical theories and the miserable living conditions of the poor to create a scene ripe for tragedy. The story of the &#x201c;cholera years&#x201d; is, in Richard Evans&#x2019;s hands, tragically revealing of the age&#x2019;s social inequalities and governmental pitilessness and incompetence; it also offers disquieting parallels with the world&#x2019;s public-health landscape today.</p><p><b>Richard J.

The conflict raged for three days and resulted in casualty figures that would not be exceeded until World War II. When discussing the Battle of Gettysburg, many historians incorrectly describe the Union forces as easily crushing the Confederate resistance. In reality, the battle's outcome was extremely close, as each side struggled for victory at this decisive stage of the war.</p><p>Robert E. Lee has been roundly criticized for sending General Pickett and his men into a hopeless assault on the Union center. In The Cavalry Battle That Saved the Union, Paul D. Walker reveals that Pickett's charge was only half of Lee's plan for a Confederate victory. Lee also ordered a simultaneous cavalry attack from the rear, led by the popular hero Jeb Stuart. If Lee's plan had succeeded, Gettysburg might have been the site of a crucial Confederate victory, one that could have changed the course of American history.</p><p>For all his military expertise, Lee had not reckoned with the sudden appearance of a Union cavalry contingent. At its head was George Armstrong Custer, whom fate had promoted to a leadership position. The two forces collided, and the resultant battle, pitting Custer's men against Stuart and his Confederates, still stands as a landmark in the history of cavalry maneuvers.</p><p>Remarkably, there is little published information available about this important episode, which involved over 12,500 men. In The Cavalry Battle That Saved the Union, Paul D. Walker not only illuminates what really occurred at Gettysburg, but also recaptures the terrible beauty and the breakneck pace of the lost art of mounted warfare. </p><p>Paul D. Walker served in the army's armored cavalry for thirty years, including two tours in Viet Nam. His discovery of this little-known episode in the history of cavalry warfare inspired him to write this book. Mr. Walker currently resides in Salt Lake City.</p><p>For information about other books from Pelican's extensive list of Civil War titles, please visit www.pelicanpub.com.</p><p>Why did Robert E. Lee send Pickett's men on a seemingly suicidal frontal attack against the Union center at Gettysburg?</p><p>Here is the answer to this question, which has perplexed legions of Civil War buffs.</p><p>Paul D. Walker reveals Lee's true plan for a Confederate victory: a simultaneous strike against the Union center from two directions--Pickett's infantry charging the front, while Stuart's cavalry struck the rear. The frontal assault by Pickett went off as scheduled, but as Stuart's forces approached, they encountered a Union cavalry contingent. As the forces joined, there was a sudden and violent collision. Then, at the head of the Northern force, emerged one of the most dynamic figures in American history, George Armstrong Custer. </p><p>What followed was America's greatest cavalry battle: 7,500 Confederate horsemen ranged against 5,000 Union cavalry--Jeb Stuart against George Custer--with the outcome of the battle at Gettysburg, and possibly the entire Civil War, at stake.</p></p><h2>A Short History of the World (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Of the more than one hundred books that H.

Wodehouse</h2><p><b>What ho! A new Jeeves and Wooster novel that is "impossible to read without grinning idiotically" (<i>Evening Standard</i>), penned in homage to P.G. Wodehouse by bestselling author Ben Schott -- in which literature's favorite master and servant become spies for the English Crown.</b><br>The misadventures of Bertie Wooster and his incomparable personal gentleman, Jeeves, have delighted audiences for nearly a century. Now bestselling author Ben Schott brings this odd couple back to life in a madcap new adventure full of the hijinks, entanglements, imbroglios, and Wodehousian wordplay that readers love. <br>In this latest uproarious adventure, the Junior Ganymede Club (an association of England's finest butlers and valets) is revealed to be an elite arm of the British secret service. Jeeves must ferret out a Fascist spy embedded in the highest social circles, and only his hapless employer, Bertie, can help. Unfolding in the background are school-chum capers, affairs of the heart, antics with aunts, and sartorial set-tos. <br>Energized by Schott's effervescent prose, and fully authorized by the Wodehouse Estate, JEEVES AND THE KING OF CLUBS is a delight for lifelong fans and the perfect introduction to two of fiction's most beloved comic characters.</p><p><b>Ben Schott</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> and internationally bestselling author of <i>Schott's Miscellany </i>and the <i>Schott's Almanac</i> series.

With this lyrical novel, tinged with a hallucinatory eroticism that unfolds over three unforgettable days, celebrated Greek author Ersi Sotiropoulos depicts Cavafy in the midst of a journey of self-discovery across a continent on the brink of massive change. He is by turns exhilarated and tormented by his homosexuality; the Greek-Turkish War has ended in Greece&#x2019;s defeat and humiliation; France is torn by the Dreyfus Affair, and Cavafy&#x2019;s native Alexandria has surrendered to the indolent rhythms of the East. A stunning portrait of a budding author&#x2015;before he became C.P. Cavafy, one of the 20th century&#x2019;s greatest poets&#x2015;that illuminates the complex relationship of art, life, and the erotic desires that trigger creativity.</p></p><p><b>Ersi Sotiropoulos</b> has written fifteen books of fiction and poetry.

That exquisite curve, the pale skin, paler against the dirty sheet. Nothing written on skin can be erased, I told myself. Five years ago, at a similar hour, you stirred in your sleep and your thigh brushed against me. I was still wearing my shirt. My hand slid over your chest, which was hairless and tawny with an undertone of ochre. I remem�ber it strong, hairless, bright. The line of your mouth, that pink, open circle, and the gleam of a tooth, barely visible. A bit of dried saliva. I traced your lips with my fingers. Then my hand crept lower, lower still. You breathed, snoring slightly. In your sleep you rolled over and wrapped your arms around me. You murmured a word I didn&#x2019;t know. Perhaps you were thirsty. My hand opened and closed ... </i></p><i><br><br><p>A shudder swept over the empty bed. I&#x2019;d left the window open and the curtains flut�tered in the Parisian breeze. It was time I abandoned these r�veries. John would be waiting in the lobby.</p></i><br><p>The earth still seemed flat then, and night fell all at once until the end of the world, where someone hunched in the light of a lamp would be able to see, centuries later, a red sun setting over ruins, would be able to see, beyond seas and ruined harbors, countries lost in time living in the glow of triumph, in the slow agony of defeat. History repeats itself, he thought, though he wasn&#x2019;t sure whether it really was repetition. His talent and persistence alone would allow him to see. Gripping his pen, he listened. Sounds, lights, smells, it all came flooding back. It was night once more on the flat earth. Voices reached his ears. A strain of cheap music from Attarin where the shops were open late, the sound of a barrel organ whose saccharine melody swelled and overflowed and climbed the muddy stairs. In the rooms upstairs limbs mingled on threadbare sheets. For half an hour of perfect pleas-ure, half an hour of absolute, sensual pleasure. Limbs, lips, eyelids on the squalid bed, kisses, gasping mouths. Then they would leave separately like fugitives, knowing this half an hour would haunt the rest of their lives, knowing they would return to seek it again. But now all they wanted was for the night to swallow them up, and as each hurried down the stairs that unbearable tinkle of music greeted him once more, a wobbly chime that mocked the oppressive thud of his heart. The street outside was always deserted, and the footsteps of an invisible shadow would echo in the distance, then fade. He&#x2019;d stand for a moment in the doorway, then button his coat and walk quickly away, hugging the wall, head bent, collar raised. And sometimes it happened, it had in fact happened, that his eyes would meet the eyes of another man skidding like a rat through the darkness, some nervous, well-dressed man coming from the other direction, heading hypnotized toward those same stairs, that same room, to roll over those same stained sheets.</p><br><br> <p>And if the lovers don&#x2019;t respond to your touch? he thought. If they&#x2019;re warm, soft-skinned statues that receive all caresses with the indifference of works of art? That Platonic idea enticed him, but only to a point. The object of desire was so distant, so close. Lips, limbs, bodies. Lips, gasping mouths. That was what he should write about. So close, so distant. That was the purpose of art, to abolish distance.</p><br><br> <p>He recalled the figure of a youth from years ago. Had it been in Constantinople? Yenik�y? A beardless youth working as an ironmonger&#x2019;s apprentice, and as the boy bent half naked over the anvil, sparks flying onto his glistening chest, he saw his face lit heroi�cally, imagined him crowned with vines and bay leaves. They hadn&#x2019;t spoken, and he never saw him again. Who would write about him? Who would heave him up out of the oblivion of History?</p><br><br> <p>Years later, someone hunched in the light of a lamp would be able to see a red sun set�ting over mythical cities, would see burning grass through rusted iron, where once a marble foun�tain spurted water and the last droplets ran dry in the evening light. He would see the crimson rays shining on the young body of the apprentice in Yenik�y, fleetingly illuminating a possibility, yes, a possibility that assumed substance, an almost material sub�stance, as that same youth now weaved between the columns of an ancient agora among the crowds of Antioch or Seleucia, and many were they who praised his beauty.</p><br><br> <p>That &#x201c;years later&#x201d; is now, he thought. He alone could see. Only he wasn&#x2019;t yet ready. His impatience chafed at him, and contrived miserable, graceless poems, which he tore up in self-reproach. And then there was that clunky pastiche ... A heap of adjectives and too-fine turns of phrase, the churning runoff of a lyricism he hated but didn&#x2019;t know how to leave behind. How can I shake free of that sentimental burden? he wondered. Often during the day he felt useless, irresolute, a failure. The problem was Alexandria, the city stifled him. His provincial life, his circle of silly people with their unshakable self-confidence, the feluccas and fellahin, the landscape like a cobwebbed stencil whose heavy humidity sank into your bones&#x2015;it all weakened his nerves. And often he deter�mined, without really believing it, that he needed to erase the Alexandria within him if he really wanted to write.</p><br><br> <p>But now he was in a foreign city that charmed and repelled him in equal measure, a cosmopolitan capital that glittered with refinement, whose smallest corner seemed large and important. He needed to resist his bad mood and find a way to enjoy these final few days of the trip. No more wavering, he thought, I&#x2019;ll make a daily schedule and stick to it. He reflexively straightened his tie and descended the three steps into the hotel lobby.</p><br><br> <p>&#x201c;Monsieur Cavafy!&#x201d; he heard someone call.</p></p><h2>Baseball Genius: Baseball Genius 1 (Jeter Publishing)</h2><p>An average kid with an above average talent for predicting baseball pitches tries to help his favorite player out of a slump in this entertaining novel from bestselling authors Tim Green and Derek Jeter.<br><br>Jalen DeLuca loves baseball.

A man in a black knit cap sat at the counter with a newspaper, a cup of coffee, and a piece of pie. In one booth a young, awkward-looking couple in fancy clothes scowled at each other, arguing in silence behind the glass. Jalen watched his father deliver two plates of his special stuffed calamari to the couple. While the Silver Liner was a diner, it was also much more: a place for authentic Italian food. While the two didn&#x2019;t seem to go together, Jalen&#x2019;s father somehow seemed to scratch out a living.<br> <br>When a car drove up with new customers, Jalen knew he had time to sneak off into the spring night. He snugged the empty backpack on his shoulders as he crossed the railroad tracks. Wind picked at his curly hair, and he paused at the wailing sound of a distant train.<br> <br>Beside the station stood a fast-food place, the lights on its big yellow-and-blue-and-purple sign extinguished for the night, since it closed after the last train arrived from New York. Jalen&#x2019;s dad usually let his help go after dinnertime but squeezed a few extra dollars from the Silver Liner by staying open late, even after midnight, if he had any customers.<br> <br>Main Street was empty, but Jalen decided to take a detour and avoid the streetlamps. He jogged fifteen minutes to the other side of town, all uphill, to Rockton&#x2019;s oldest and biggest estate. It had been built in 1782 by the great-great-grandfather (step-great-great-grandfather, she&#x2019;d always point out) of one of his best friends, Cat Hewlett. Its heavy iron gates stood open, but he stopped to catch his breath. Fastened to one of the great stone columns by a thick chain was a bronze plaque letting visitors know they were about to enter Mount Tipton. Jalen wondered what name his home would go by if anyone cared to call it anything. Probably Broken Box or maybe Shabby Shack.<br> <br>He darted through the gates and into the shadows, avoiding the long, sweeping driveway and the lights buried in the grass alongside it. His friends were waiting for him at the corner of the stables. The rich smell of horse manure swirled deep in Jalen&#x2019;s nose. Daniel Bellone didn&#x2019;t even smell it anymore. He and his family lived above the horses, along with two other families who helped maintain Mount Tipton in all its original glory, trimming the gardens and grass, painting the buildings, scrubbing floors, and polishing the brass and silver when needed.<br> <br>Cat lived in the big house&#x2014;as Daniel called it&#x2014;but with her messy brown hair, scrubby jeans, and the sweatshirt she wore, she looked like she was the one who lived above the stables.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; she asked, snapping her gum and cutting the barn smell with a whiff of peppermint. She bumped fists with Jalen. Even Cat&#x2019;s raspy voice and the smudge on her face couldn&#x2019;t hide how pretty she was.<br> <br>&#x201c;As I&#x2019;ll ever be.&#x201d; Jalen bumped Daniel&#x2019;s fist, then turned to look down the hill, over the treetops, at the big brick house a quarter mile beyond Mount Tipton&#x2019;s stone wall. The huge mansion sat on a hilltop of its own, bathed in soft yellow light.<br> <br>Jalen and Cat trudged off down the grassy slope, following Daniel, who knew the way through the tangle of riding trails better than anyone. They skirted the trout pond on a wide, grassy trail before plunging into the woods. The trees above swished in the wind. The beam of the flashlight on Cat&#x2019;s phone flicked this way and that so that shadows of the thick tree trunks danced and jumped. When they reached the high stone wall marking Tipton&#x2019;s boundary, Daniel pulled up.<br> <br>&#x201c;You sure about this?&#x201d; Cat asked Jalen, directing the light at their feet so that its glow lit the three friends&#x2019; faces.<br> <br>Jalen was surprised. &#x201c;Why are you saying this now? We all agreed. It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;ve got a barrelful of choices.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Cat&#x2019;s voice drifted off on the wind. She looked toward the estate, but they all knew that her stepfather gave her nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Daniel looked slightly embarrassed. His fee for the travel baseball team had been paid. His spot on the Rockets was secured.<br> <br>Without words, Jalen tried to tell Daniel that it was okay. Daniel&#x2019;s parents were two of the hardest-working people Jalen had ever seen. It wasn&#x2019;t his fault that Jalen couldn&#x2019;t afford the travel team fees, and Daniel could.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be careful of the dogs.&#x201d; Daniel peered out from beneath a shock of hair as dark as the night and shook his head before uttering his version of a curse. &#x201c;Hot sauce.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Jalen patted his pants pocket and the pork chop bones wrapped in plastic tucked inside. He bit his lip and started to climb the rock wall, inserting the toes of his sneakers into the cracks. When he reached the top of the ten-foot wall, he straddled the flat fieldstones and looked down at his friends below.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe we should go with you?&#x201d; Daniel&#x2019;s face was hidden in the gloom, and his whisper barely rose above the trees.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Jalen said. &#x201c;But no. If it goes bad, I could be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t know. Arrested?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think&#x2014;&#x201d; Cat began, before a long pause during which her face grew grim. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So, no sense in taking you guys down too,&#x201d; Jalen said. &#x201c;Thanks for coming this far.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll wait right here,&#x201d; Daniel said. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cat began to climb the wall.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Cat,&#x201d; Jalen said. &#x201c;I told you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She reached the top and sat with her legs hanging down on the Tipton side as she held up her phone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep it here, in case you get lost. It&#x2019;ll be a beacon.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jalen gave her leg a pat. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s not me for any reason, jump and run.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be you.&#x201d; Cat&#x2019;s blue eyes glittered, even in the dim light. &#x201c;You can do this. It&#x2019;ll work, and you&#x2019;ll be on that travel team going up and down the East Coast, knocking in runs and turning twos.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Jalen let himself down a few feet before simply springing away from the wall and dropping to the ground. He didn&#x2019;t look back because he didn&#x2019;t want to chicken out. He plunged into the darkness of the trees, waiting for his eyes to adjust, stumbling through the open woods, his eyes fixed on the lights of the huge brick mansion owned by a New York Yankees star.<br> <br>Jalen&#x2019;s stomach felt empty and cold and fragile, like a fist in wintertime without a glove. It wasn&#x2019;t just the darkness. It wasn&#x2019;t just being completely alone. It wasn&#x2019;t just the danger.<br> <br>It was that&#x2014;despite all the rules Jalen had bent in his life&#x2014;he&#x2019;d never taken anything that didn&#x2019;t belong to him.<br> <br>Never stolen so much as a candy bar.<br> <br>That was about to change.</p><h2>Monster Files: A Look Inside Government Secrets and Classified Documents on Bizarre Creatures and Extraordinary Animals</h2><p>Does the Pentagon have the body of Bigfoot on ice?<br>What is the U.S. military hiding from us about lake monsters?<br>What is the link between the CIA and the abominable snowman?<br>Why is there a British government file on sea serpents?<br>What do the Russians know about animal ESP?<br><br>For decades there have been persistent rumors, tales, and legends that government agencies all around the world have been secretly collecting and studying data on bizarre beasts, amazing animals, and strange creatures.<br><br>Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, sea serpents, psychic pets, the chupacabras, and the abominable snowman have all attracted official, classified interest.<br><br>Now, for the first time, the full, fearsome facts are finally revealed in Nick Redfern's <i>Monster Files</i>.<br><br>You'll discover all the amazing cryptozoological truths, conspiracies, and cover-ups behind the secret studies by the Pentagon, the Kremlin, and the British military, among many others.<br><br>Despite what your parents might have told you when you were a child, monsters, creepy creatures, and terrifying beasts really do exist.

His life-long obsession with old Shanghai and the foreigners who once lived in the most cosmopolitan of world cities has led to his researching many tales and life stories, some of which are gathered in <em>Destination Shanghai</em>.The breadth of French's research into the world of Shanghai in the first half of the 20th century is conspicuously evident in Destination Shanghai, a collection of eighteen biographical essays which catalogue the visits of a range of foreigners to the city. These range from stars of the screen, such as Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, to writers like Andr� Malraux, Arthur Ransome and Langston Hughes, and oddballs such as the English occultist (and amateur mountaineer) Aleister Crowley. Perhaps most compelling are those who French drags back from relative obscurity, such as the actor Warner Oland&#x2015;a Swedish American who ended up playing a Hawaiian Chinese detective: Charlie Chan. Oland was a big star in the 1930s, both in America and China: Lu Xun apparently never missed a screening of a new Chan movie. When Oland arrived in Shanghai aboard a steamship, he told the waiting press how happy he was to be visiting the land of his ancestors. The motivations of those who traveled in search of Destination Shanghai were diverse, and their experiences distinct; the pieces coalesce however to form an esoteric, scholarly and enjoyable portrait of the city and a miscellaneous cast of its storied visitors. -- Jonathan Chatwin, <i>Asian Review Of Books</i><br><br>Paul French's entertaining Destination Shanghai relates 18 stories of Westerners in Shanghai during the 20th century, some of them famous, others unknown. ... French is fastidious in his research and provides much illuminating detail &#x2013; both historical context and narrative minutiae &#x2013; where it is available, so we learn, for instance, precisely which bars American playwright Eugene O'Neill visited on an epic pub crawl. ... It is the individuals usually omitted from the city's grand narra�tive, though, that often make for the most interesting reading, help�ing to compensate for the preponderance of Western voices in a book about a Chinese city. French shows sensitivity for the less privileged: members of the hitherto obscure 30s-40s Roma community, for example, who mostly made a living in entertain�ment, and who we know of only because Romany entertainers were considered fashionable and so tended to advertise their ethnicity, rather than obscuring it to avoid prejudice. ... Similarly, a section on poets Langston Hughes and Irene West casts light on the forgotten contribution of African-Americans to the culture of Shanghai in the 30s. Hughes' 1938 poem &#x201c;Roar, China!&#x201d;, with its fierce condemnation of both Japanese militarism and Western colonialism, neatly pricks the bubble of golden-era Shanghai. French never neglects this side of the story, in particular the monstrous poverty and exploitation that underpinned the freewheel�ing international glamour of the city's Western enclaves. -- Richard Lord, <i>South China Morning Post</i></p><h2>Phantom Architecture</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>Art and Photography</h2><p>This text offers a comprehensive survey of a rich and important period of photographic history, from the 1960s to the 21st century.

Billington, renowned historian of the Old West, described this collection. David Dary, award-winning chronicler of life on the frontier plains, is at his entertaining best in these thirty-nine episodes, sagas, and tales from Kansas's vigorous, free-spirited past. Many of the stories appeared in Dary's True Tales of the Old-Time Plains, but that book, out of print for several years, focused on the Great Plains in general. This new edition, revised and with additional stories and a new title, pulls together tales about people, animals and events in what is today Kansas, including the old territory of Kansas (1854-1861) that stretched from the Missouri River westward to the summit of the Rocky Mountains. <br><br>Many of the tales capture the romance, excitement, and adventure of the Old West, while others have the tempo of a quiet life surrounded by the immensity of the plains and prairies. There are well-known characters: Bill Cody, the Dalton gang, the Bloody Benders, William Clarke Quantrill, Abraham Lincoln, and Frederic Remington, who once owned a Kansas sheep ranch and later was a silent partner in a Kansas City saloon before he became a well-known artist. <br><br>And there are stories, too, about little-known characters such as Prairie Dog Dave Morrow, who made his living capturing live prairie dogs. Dary relates tales of lost treasure and sudden riches, of outlaws and "jayhawk" raiders, of massacres and heroics. A generous number of illustrations help bring the tales to life.</p><p>&#39;Rollicking, adventurous, touching.

Mr. Telmer had spotted them talking together in the hall before homeroom, and ordered them into his office.<br> <br>And now they stared at the computer screen he had turned their way.<br> <br>Mr. Telmer clicked the mouse, and they watched the video again: Three kids hurried along a dark hallway, their faces fuzzy in the red glow of an exit sign. The kids in the video looked a lot like them.<br> <br>The principal had gotten an anonymous e-mail&#x2014;a YouTube link to ten seconds of video with a dangerous title: &#x201c;Pratt, Acton, and Gerritt Crash the School.&#x201d; The location was unmistakable: the first floor hallway near the office of the Captain Duncan Oakes School. And the time stamp on the video? May 30, 3:17 a.m., which was last Friday night&#x2014;actually Saturday morning.<br> <br>Ben forced his eyes to stay on the screen, afraid he would suddenly look up at the principal and shout, Okay, we&#x2019;re guilty! Call the police! Bring the handcuffs!<br> <br>One thought looped through his mind.<br> <br>We&#x2019;re dead! We are so dead! We&#x2019;re dead!<br> <br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; growled Mr. Telmer. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on here?&#x201d;<br> <br>From deep inside his private tunnel of fear, Ben thought he heard laughter.<br> <br>Am I crazy?<br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t. Robert Gerritt was laughing.<br> <br>Then Robert&#x2019;s voice: &#x201c;Sorry, Mr. Telmer. I&#x2019;m not being disrespectful, honest&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t help it!&#x201d;<br> <br>Ben snapped fully alert as Robert kept talking.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because this looks like a huge prank, sir. Somebody used a phone camera to shoot three kids in the empty hallway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and changed the exposure so it would look like the middle of the night, and then added a fake time stamp, slapped our names on it, uploaded it to YouTube, and sent the link to your e-mail&#x2014;which is right there on the school&#x2019;s website. That&#x2019;s what it looks like.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Telmer started to speak, but Robert didn&#x2019;t let him.<br> <br>&#x201c;And now, we&#x2019;re all here feeling sort of stupid. And, really, I&#x2019;m sorry I laughed. I mean, I can&#x2019;t say where Jill was on Saturday at three thirty in the morning, but Ben and I were having a sleepover at my house&#x2014;you can ask my mom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean, my grandma&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Robert stopped dramatically and sniffed, and then sniffed again each time he paused. &#x201c;Because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I live with Gram now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because my mom and dad&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. aren&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know, they&#x2019;re not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they&#x2019;re not here anymore!&#x201d;<br> <br>As Ben watched with a mixture of horror and awe, Robert sobbed, buried his face in his hands, and looked like he was having a mental breakdown right there in front of the principal&#x2019;s desk, moaning and gurgling as he slumped backward onto a wooden chair.<br> <br><br> <br>Ben and Jill just stared, and Mr. Telmer didn&#x2019;t know what to do.<br> <br>But he was the principal, so he had to do something. He hurried around the end of his desk and awkwardly patted Robert&#x2019;s shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;There, there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s okay. I&#x2019;m sure that this is just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a very bad joke. And I&#x2019;m sorry it brought all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all that back for you. There, it&#x2019;s okay, Robert. Come, you should go now, all of you, go on to your homerooms&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>As Robert got his sobbing under control, the principal helped him to his feet and handed him a couple of tissues from the box on his desk. Robert blew his nose while Mr. Telmer steered him out his door, through the main office, and into the hallway. Ben and Jill were close behind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, I want you kids to have a good day, all right? And let&#x2019;s just forget this happened. That&#x2019;s good&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so have a great day!&#x201d;<br> <br>And with that, the principal hurried back into his office and shut the door.<br> <br>Before they had walked ten feet, Robert had made a full recovery.<br> <br>&#x201c;Glad that&#x2019;s over,&#x201d; he muttered, then gave his nose one more blast.<br> <br>Ben was still in shock. Because, what Robert had said about his mom and dad? That was true. They had died in a car crash when he was in kindergarten. But the way he had just used that terrible fact?<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow, Gerritt! You really&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean, wow! That was just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wow!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jill was too shaken to be gushy. &#x201c;Yeah, nice going, but that was a very close call!&#x201d;<br> <br>It was Monday morning. The front hallway was crowded with kids, but Ben felt like the three of them were the only ones there. And for sure, they were the only kids who knew that a war was raging inside this old building.<br> <br>He scowled as they walked toward the south stairwell. It had been a bad weekend for the Keepers of the School. The kids on the YouTube video? That actually was Jill and Robert and him&#x2014;inside the school at three thirty on Saturday morning. Illegally. They had just confirmed an important discovery under the stairs in the northwest corner&#x2014;a secret Underground Railroad station, a discovery that should have permanently preserved the whole school and totally ended the Glennley Group&#x2019;s plans to build their new amusement park. But that creep Lyman had surprised them again, this time with a low-tech security device&#x2014;a snarling Rottweiler named Moose. They had panicked, and they forgot to lock the secret door to the compartment, which is why the dog had been able to scratch his way in. So Lyman had found the hideout, realized what it was, and then his bosses at Glennley headquarters took over. In a huge rush, they had contacted all sorts of heritage and preservation groups. And late Saturday afternoon, the Glennley Group had issued a press release. They announced the discovery as if it were theirs, and made a promise to the world: They were going to keep this newly found Underground Railroad station just as it was, safe in its own small corner of the original school. But most of the old building was still going to be demolished to make room for their newest cheesy theme park, Tall Ships Ahoy!<br> <br>On Sunday evening the school superintendent had held a press conference on the front steps of the Oakes School, and all the TV news stations from Boston had been there. Dr. Gill had smiled and smiled, talking into a cluster of microphones.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know I speak for the whole town of Edgeport when I say we are thrilled about this exciting discovery! The legacy of the Captain Duncan Oakes School will live on here forever, even though most of the building behind me will be gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>When a reporter asked who had actually found the runaway slave hideout, the superintendent smiled again. &#x201c;That person has chosen to remain anonymous so that the discovery itself can remain the center of attention.&#x201d;<br> <br>So, thanks to Lyman and his dog, the big amusement park plans were still on track. In less than two weeks, the old school and the town of Edgeport and its quiet harbor would be changed forever.<br> <br>&#x201c;That is not happening!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; asked Robert.<br> <br>Ben realized he&#x2019;d said that last bit out loud.<br> <br>The three of them stopped near the doors to the south stairwell.<br> <br>Ben talked through clenched teeth. &#x201c;I said, Lyman and his sneaky lawyers and his nasty dog are not going to win!&#x201d;<br> <br>Robert grinned. &#x201c;Of course not, Pratt. Relax! Look, I&#x2019;ve gotta go check on something in the library before homeroom, but don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ve got some ideas about the next safeguard, and how we are gonna spend some serious cash! Later.&#x201d; Gerritt took off toward the library.<br> <br>Jill looked at Ben. &#x201c;So, how did Lyman get that video of us?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged. &#x201c;Probably a motion-activated camera. But sending it to the principal? That&#x2019;s new. He wants to get us kicked out of school&#x2014;or sent to jail. And his first shot was almost a direct hit.&#x201d;<br> <br>The homeroom warning bell clanged three times.<br> <br>Jill said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk before math, okay? But don&#x2019;t take this stuff personally, Benjamin. That&#x2019;s partly why Lyman&#x2019;s so good&#x2014;he&#x2019;s just doing his job. We can learn from him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Ben said, &#x201c;but can we beat him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have to,&#x201d; Jill said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all&#x2014;we have to.&#x201d; She gave him a half smile, then hit the stairs.<br> <br>Ben walked toward the art room, which meant he had to go right past the door to the janitor&#x2019;s workshop. He was dreading an encounter with Lyman. The guy had stolen that whole Underground Railroad thing&#x2014;a major victory. And now this new video attack, using the principal as a weapon? That was nasty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. truly vicious. Like his Rottweiler.<br> <br>Ben tapped his tongue against the back of his front teeth, a nervous habit. He really wanted to avoid Lyman. The guy was sure to give him one of those oily, sneering smiles.<br> <br>The workroom was open, and just before he got there, Ben saw the end of the janitor&#x2019;s long trash cart come nosing out the doorway. He wanted to duck and slip past, but he couldn&#x2019;t help glancing left, straight into Lyman&#x2019;s face. And when he did that, he had to stop.<br> <br>Ben stood there directly in front of the trash cart, heart pounding, almost in a trance.<br> <br>The man shot him a dark, angry look.<br> <br>&#x201c;Move it, Pratt!&#x201d;<br> <br>Ben jumped aside, but he kept staring at the janitor.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t Lyman.<br> <br></p><h2>Conducting Business: Unveiling the Mystery Behind the Maestro (Amadeus)</h2><p>Conducting an orchestra is something that is seen as well as heard, but it is quite misunderstood when it comes to knowing what this person actually does for a living. This most mysterious of jobs is brought to life for the music lover as well as for the aspiring maestro in a new book by Leonard Slatkin.<br><br>Drawing on his own experiences on and off the podium, Slatkin brings us into the world of the baton. He tells tales of some of the most fascinating people in the musical world, including Frank Sinatra, Leonard Bernstein, and John Williams. He takes the reader to the great concert halls and orchestras, soundstages in Hollywood, and opera pits around the globe.<br><br>Mr. Slatkin recounts his controversial appearance at the Metropolitan Opera, his creation and direction of summer music festivals, and a shattering concert experience that took place four days following 9/11. Life in the recording studio and on the road as well as health issues confronting the conductor provide an insider's glimpse into the private world of public figures.<br><br>Covering everything from learning how to read music to standing in front of an orchestra for the first time, what to wear, and how to deal with the press, <i>Conducting Business</i> is a unique look at a unique profession. <br><br><i>Conducting Business</i> is a recipient of the 2013 ASCAP Deems Taylor Special Recognition Award.</p><p><b>Leonard Slatkin</b> (Detroit, MI) has held positions that include directorships with orchestras in Washington DC, Saint Louis, Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles and at the BBC. He has been nominated for 60 Grammys and won seven. His awards include the National Medal for the Arts and honorary degrees from twelve universities.These stories revealing, candid, colorful, and sometimes hilarious provide the vehicle for many of Slatkin s most insightful observations about the 'conducting business' and his own career within it. They are also what make the book a page-turner, not only for those 'in pursuit of a conducting career' but for anyone interested in the conducting profession and the world of orchestras. --Symphony Now<br><br>One of the world's most highly regarded conductors, Slatkin--music director and conductor of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and the Orchestre National de Lyon and principal guest Conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra--opens a door into the private world of maestros. This is a collection of Slatkin's personal thoughts; it resembles a freewheeling, idiosyncratic journal. Even though there are nominally three parts, the book is not bound by an overarching structure. It is a collection: part autobiography, part tips for aspiring conductors, part conducting text, and part charming anecdotes. The reader who wants to learn more about the life of a jet-setting conductor will find much to savor. The prose is conversational, not academic. There are no footnotes or scholarly index. One sees only from Slatkin's point of view. But Slatkin honestly discusses his career accomplishments at the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, National Symphony, and BBC Orchestra. He also tells the reader much about his personality and character and his dedication to teaching, at the National Conducting Institute and at Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music. The book is not meant for academic collections, but it is a unique and an intimate portrait and arevealing behind-the-scenes look at classical music. --Choice Magazine<br><br>The demands of the conducting profession are dealt with head on, and there is much affection for people and insight into music that will endear musicians and music-lovers alike to a beautifully written, very human and rewarding manuscript. --TimeOut London<br><br>''This is a highly personal but also impressively honest and straightforward account of a profession that has, indeed, been 'veiled in mystery,' at least since the twentieth century if not earlier.'' --Examiner.com<br><br>The demands of the conducting profession are dealt with head on, and there is much affection for people and insight into music that will endear musicians and music-lovers alike to a beautifully written, very human and rewarding manuscript. --TimeOut London</p><h2>Tomatoland: How Modern Industrial Agriculture Destroyed Our Most Alluring Fruit</h2><p>Based on a James Beard award-winning article from a leading voice on the politics of agribusiness, Tomatoland combines history, legend, passion for taste, and investigative reporting on modern agribusiness and environmental issues into a revealing, controversial look at the tomato, the fruit we love so much that we eat $4 billion-worth annually.<br><br><b>2012 IACP Award Winner in the Food Matters category</b><br><br>Supermarket produce sections bulging with a year-round supply of perfectly round, bright red-orange tomatoes have become all but a national birthright. But in <i>Tomatoland</i>, which is based on his James Beard Award-winning article, "The Price of Tomatoes," investigative food journalist Barry Estabrook reveals the huge human and environmental cost of the $5 billion fresh tomato industry. Fields are sprayed with more than one hundred different herbicides and pesticides. Tomatoes are picked hard and green and artificially gassed until their skins acquire a marketable hue. Modern plant breeding has tripled yields, but has also produced fruits with dramatically reduced amounts of calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C, and tomatoes that have fourteen times more sodium than the tomatoes our parents enjoyed. The relentless drive for low costs has fostered a thriving modern-day slave trade in the United States. How have we come to this point? &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Estabrook traces the supermarket tomato from its birthplace in the deserts of Peru to the impoverished town of Immokalee, Florida, a.k.a. the tomato capital of the United States. He visits the laboratories of seedsmen trying to develop varieties that can withstand the rigors of agribusiness and still taste like a garden tomato, and then moves on to commercial growers who operate on tens of thousands of acres, and eventually to a hillside field in Pennsylvania, where he meets an obsessed farmer who produces delectable tomatoes for the nation's top restaurants.<br><br>Throughout <i>Tomatoland</i>, Estabrook presents a who's who cast of characters in the tomato industry: the avuncular octogenarian whose conglomerate grows one out of every eight tomatoes eaten in the United States; the ex-Marine who heads the group that dictates the size, color, and shape of every tomato shipped out of Florida; the U.S. attorney who has doggedly prosecuted human traffickers for the past decade; and the Guatemalan peasant who came north to earn money for his parents' medical bills and found himself enslaved for two years.<br><br><i>Tomatoland</i> reads like a suspenseful whodunit as well as an expose of today's agribusiness systems and the price we pay as a society when we take taste and thought out of our food purchases.</p><p>James Beard Award-winning journalist Barry Estabrook was a contributing editor at <i>Gourmet</i> magazine for eight years, writing investigative articles about where food comes from.

His work has been anthologized in the Best American Food Writing series, and he has been interviewed on numerous television and radio shows. He lives and grows tomatoes in his garden in Vermont."In this eye-opening expos�, Vermont journalist Estabrook traces the sad, tasteless life of the mass-produced tomato, from its chemical-saturated beginnings in south Florida to far-flung supermarkets. Expanding on his 2010 James Beard Award-winning article in Gourmet magazine, Estabrook first looks at the tomato's ancestors in Peru, grown naturally in coastal deserts and Andean foothills, with fruit the size of large peas. Crossbreeding produced bigger, juicier varieties, and by the late 19th century, Florida had muscled in on the U.S. market, later benefiting from the embargo on Cuban tomatoes; the Sunshine State now produces one-third of the fresh tomatoes in this country. To combat sandy soil devoid of nutrients, and weather that breeds at least 27 insect species and 29 diseases that prey on the plants, Florida growers bombard tomato plants with a dizzying cocktail of herbicides and pesticides, then gas the "mature greens" (fruit plucked so early from the vines that they bounce without a scratch) with ethylene. Behind the scenes, moreover, there exists a horrendous culture of exploitation of Hispanic laborers in places like Immokalee, where pesticide exposure has led to birth defects and long-term medical ailments. Estabrook concludes this thought-provoking book with some ideas from innovators trying to build a better tomato." --Publisher's Weekly<br><br>"With great skill and compassion, Estabrook explores the science, ingenuity, and human misery behind the modern American tomato. Once again, the true cost is too high to pay." --Eric Schlosser, author of Fast Food Nation<br><br>"In my ten years as editor of Gourmet magazine, the article I am proudest to have published was Barry Estabrook's 'The Price of Tomatoes.' Now he's expanded that into this astonishingly moving and important book. If you have ever eaten a tomato--or ever plan to--you must read Tomatoland. It will change the way you think about America's most popular 'vegetable.' More importantly, it will give you new insight into the way America farms." --Ruth Reichl, author of Garlic and Sapphires<br><br>"If you worry, as I do, about the sad and sorry state of the tomato today, and want to know what a tomato used to be like and what it could hopefully become again, read Barry Estabrook's Tomatoland. This book is a fascinating history of the peregrination of the tomato throughout the centuries." --Jacques P�pin, author of the forthcoming Essential Pepin<br><br>"In fast-moving, tautly narrated scenes, Barry Estabrook tells the startling story of labor conditions that should not exist in this country or this century, and makes sure you won't look at a supermarket or fast-food tomato the same way again. But he also gives hope for a better future--and a better tomato. Anyone who cares about social justice should read Tomatoland. Also anyone who cares about finding a good tomato you can feel good about eating." --Corby Kummer, senior editor at The Atlantic and author of The Pleasures of Slow Food<br><br>" `Tomatoland' (is) in the tradition of the best muckraking journalism, from Upton Sinclair's `The Jungle' to Eric Schlosser's `Fast Food Nation.'

He is generally regarded by scholars as the most important American novelist before James Fenimore Cooper. He is the most frequently studied and republished practitioner of the &#34;early American novel,&#34; or the US novel between 1789 and roughly 1820. Although Brown was not the first American novelist, as some early criticism claimed, the breadth and complexity of his achievement as a writer in multiple genres (novels, short stories, essays and periodical writings of every sort, poetry, historiography, reviews) makes him a crucial figure in US literature and culture of the 1790s and first decade of the 19th century, and a significant public intellectual in the wider Atlantic print culture and public sphere of the era of the French Revolution.</p><h2>Letting It Go</h2><p><p><b>A Holocaust survivor struggles to let go of the past</b></p><p>Miriam Katin has the light hand of a master storyteller in this flowing, expressive, full-color masterpiece. A Holocaust survivor and mother, Katin's world is turned upside down by the news that her adult son is moving to Berlin, a city she's villainized for the past forty years. As she struggles to accept her son's decision, she visits the city twice, first to see her son and then to attend a museum gala featuring her own artwork. What she witnesses firsthand is a city coming to terms with its traumatic past, much as Katin is herself. <i>Letting It Go</i> is a deft and careful balance: wry, self-deprecating anecdotes counterpoint a serious account of the myriad ways trauma inflects daily existence, both for survivors and for their families.<br>Katin's first book, <i>We Are On Our Own</i>, was a memoir of her childhood, detailing how she and her mother hid in the Hungarian countryside, disguising themselves as a peasant woman and her illegitimate child in order to escape the Nazis. The stunning story, along with Katin's gorgeous pencil work, immediately garnered acclaim in the comics world and beyond. With <i>Letting It Go</i>, Katin's storytelling and artistic skills allow her to explore a voice and perspective like no other found in the medium.</p></p><p><p><b>Miriam Katin</b> was born in Hungary during World War II. She later immigrated to Israel and then the United States, where she worked in background design for animation studios such as MTV and Disney. Her debut graphic novel was the award-winning memoir <i>We Are On Our Own</i>. She currently lives in Washington Heights with her husband and a giant <i>Ficus benjamina</i> tree.</p>*Starred Review* Katin, a Holocaust survivor who told the harrowing story of her family&#x2019;s survival in her 2006 graphic memoir, We Are on Our Own, carries an understandable prejudice against all things German; so when her son Ilan announced that he was moving to Berlin to live with his girlfriend there, it set off a visceral, panicked reaction that she recounts in this wise and funny work. With wry self-awareness and sardonic humor, Katin depicts her reluctant, resentful efforts to deal with her son&#x2019;s decision as she makes a pair of visits to the city, one to visit Ilan and another to attend an art show featuring her comics work (as her ever-patient musician husband observes, &#x201c;If Barenboim can be there, so can you&#x201d;). She even learns the German word for her struggle: vergangenheitsbew�ltigung&#x2014;coming to terms with the past. Katin eschews the use of panel borders for her gorgeously expressive color-pencil drawings, giving the narrative an irresistible flow. As well told as it was, much of the power of We Are on Our Own came from its inherently dramatic story; this more nuanced and inward-looking tale is an even greater testament to Katin&#x2019;s remarkable storytelling abilities. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Case Closed, Vol. 25 (25)</h2><p>� An ongoing series in Japan&#x2014;over 54 volumes released to date, with over 84 million copies sold!<br>� Case Closed manga has sold over 185k units in the US to date!<br>� One of the best-selling titles from the pages of Japan&#x2019;s manga magazine Shonen Sunday<br>� Winner of the Shogakukan Award for Best Manga in 2001<br>� Named one of the Top 50 Manga Properties of 2005 by ICv2<br>� Anime is currently available on DVD from FUNimation<br>� Merchandise across categories in North America: accessories, calendars, TCG, etc.<br><br>When ace high school detective Jimmy Kudo is fed a mysterious substance by a pair of nefarious men in black--poof!

It is about ordinary people&#x2015;farmers, housewives, artisans, merchants, sailors, aspiring scholars&#x2015;struggling to make sense of their time and place on earth. David Hall describes a world of religious consensus and resistance: a variety of conflicting beliefs and believers ranging from the committed core to outright dissenters. He reveals for the first time the many-layered complexity of colonial religious life, and the importance within it of traditions derived from those of the Old World. We see a religion of the laity that was to merge with the tide of democratic nationalism in the nineteenth century, and that remains with us today as the essence of Protestant America.</p><p>David D. Hall is John A. Bartlett Professor of New England Church History at Harvard Divinity School.&#x201c;<i>Worlds of Wonder, Days of Judgment</i> is an extraordinarily rich evocation of the popular culture of seventeenth-century New England... A short review can only hint at the methodological brilliance and the interpretive richness of this relatively brief book. Hall succeeds not only in sketching out a new agenda for study of the New England mind but strikes out skillfully on the task of integrating the beliefs of the colonies with their everyday lives.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Francis J. Bremer</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of American History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A remarkable work of cultural history...

Hall deserves high praise for reopening an intellectual pathway to their world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;David Hall has written a work of deep learning and great subtlety. In discussing seventeenth-century New England culture, it provides a new way of looking at religious belief... Hall demonstrates that old ways simply will not do, and he redefines the character of religion and culture in New England. He has written a brilliant book, one that will stimulate its readers for many years.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Middlekauff, University of California, Berkeley</b><br><br>&#x201c;David Hall&#x2019;s highly innovative new work...provides close reading, profound insights, and trans-Atlantic comparisons that make this a book of very broad significance and interest.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Kammen, Cornell University</b><br><br>&#x201c;In this remarkable book David Hall has carried the study of early New England to new levels of understanding... He shows us, as never before, how the sophisticated doctrines of the Puritan clergy meshed, clashed, and merged with the inherited attitudes and assumptions of ordinary people in their day-to-day grappling with the mysteries of their world. This is a model of historical analysis, not merely for what it tells us about early New England, but also for its brilliant insights into the way religion can operate in society.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Edmund S.

When he was old and forgotten, living in a rundown house in the dreary suburbs of Paris, L�autaud wrote these lines. He was unmarried, childless, alone. The world of the theater in which he had worked as a critic for years was now dark for him, but from the ruins of his life these words rose. To <i>write</i>!</p> <p>One thinks of many writers who might have said this, Anne Sexton, even though she committed suicide, or Hemingway or Virginia Woolf, who both did also, or Faulkner, scorned in his rural town, or the wreckage that was Fitzgerald in the end. The thing that is marvelous is literature, which is like the sea, and the exaltation of being near it, whether you are a powerful swimmer or wading by the shore. The act of writing, though often tedious, can still provide extraordinary pleasure. For me that comes line by line at the tip of a pen, which is what I like to write with, and the page on which the lines are written, the pages, can be the most valuable thing I will ever own.</p> <p>The cynics say that if you do not write for money you are a dabbler or a fool, but this is not true. To see one's work in print is the real desire, to have it read. The remuneration is of less importance; no one was paid for the samizdats. Money is but one form of approval.</p> <p>It is such a long time that I have been writing that I don't remember the beginning. It was not a matter of doing what my father knew how to do. He had gone to Rutgers, West Point, and then MIT, and I don't think in my lifetime I ever saw him reading a novel. He read newspapers, the <i>Sun</i>, the <i>World-Telegram</i>, there were at least a dozen in New York in those days. His task was laid out for him: to rise in the world.</p> <p>Nor was my mother an avid reader. She read to me as a child, of course, and in time I read the books that were published in popular series, <i>The Hardy Boys</i> and <i>Bomba</i>, the <i>Jungle Boy</i>. I recall little about them. I did not read <i>Ivanhoe</i>, <i>Treasure Island</i>, <i>Kim</i>, or <i>The Scottish Chiefs</i>, though two or three of them were given to me. I had six volumes of a collection called <i>My Bookhouse</i>, edited by Olive Beaupr� Miller, whose name is not to be found among the various Millers&#x2015;Mrs. Alice, Henry, Joaquin, Joe&#x2015;in <i>The Reader's Encyclopedia</i>, but who was responsible for what knowledge I had of Cervantes, Dickens, Tolstoy, Homer, and the others whose work was excerpted. The contents also included folktales, fairy tales, parts of the Bible, and more. When I read of writers who when young were given the freedom of their fathers' or friends' libraries, I think of <i>Bookhouse</i>, which was that for me. It was not an education but the introduction to one.</p> <p>There were also poems, and in grammar school we had to memorize and then stand up and recite well-known poems. Many of these I still know, including Kipling's "If," which my father paid me a dollar to learn. Language is acquired, like other things, through the act of imitating, and rhythm and elegance may come in part from poems.</p> <p>I could draw quite well as a boy and even, though uninstructed, paint. What impulse made me do this, and where the ability came from&#x2015;although my father could draw a little&#x2015;I cannot say. My desire to write, apparent at the age of seven or eight, likely came from the same source. I made crude books, as many children do, with awkward printing and drawings, from small sheets of paper, folded and sewn together.</p> <p>In prep school we were poets, at least many of my friends and I were, ardent and profound. There were elegies but no love poems&#x2015;those came later. I had some early success. In a national poetry contest I won honorable mention, and sold two poems to <i>Poetry</i> magazine.</p> <p>All this was a phase, in nearly every case to be soon outgrown. In 1939 the war had broken out, and by 1941 we were in it. I ended up at West Point. The old life vanished; the new one had little use for poetry. I did read, and as an upperclassman wrote a few short stories. I had seen some in the Academy magazine and felt I could do better, and after the first one, the editor asked for more. When I became an officer there was, at first, no time for writing, nor was there the privacy. Beyond that was a greater inhibition: it was alien to the life. I had been commissioned in the Army Air Force and in the early days was a transport pilot, later switching into fighters. With that I felt I had found my role.</p> <p>Stationed in Florida in about 1950, I happened to see in a bookshop window in Pensacola a boldly displayed novel called <i>The Town and the City</i> by John Kerouac. The name. There had been a Jack Kerouac at prep school, and he had written some stories. On the back of the jacket was a photograph, a gentle, almost yearning face with eyes cast downward. I recognized it instantly. I remember a feeling of envy. Kerouac was only a few years older than I was. Somehow he had written this impressive-looking novel. I bought the book and eagerly read it. It owed a lot to Thomas Wolfe&#x2015;<i>Look Homeward</i>, <i>Angel</i> and others&#x2015;who was a major figure then, but still it was an achievement. I took it as a mark of what might be done.</p> <p>I had gotten married, and in the embrace of a more orderly life, on occasional weekends or in the evenings, I began to write again. The Korean War broke out. When I was sent over I took a small typewriter with me, thinking that if I was killed, the pages I had been writing would be a memorial. They were immature pages, to say the least. A few years later, the novel they were part of was rejected by the publishers, but one of them suggested that if I were to write another novel they would be interested in seeing it. Another novel. That might be years.</p> <p>I had a journal I had kept while flying combat missions. It contained some description, but there was little shape to it. The war had the central role. One afternoon, in Florida again&#x2015;I was there on temporary duty&#x2015;I came back from the flight line, sat down on my cot, and began to hurriedly write out a page or so of outline that had suddenly occurred to me. It would be a novel about idealism, the true and the untrue, spare and in authentic prose. What had been missing but was missing no longer was the plot.</p> <p>Why was I writing? It was not for glory; I had seen what I took to be real glory. It was not for acclaim. I knew that if the book was published, it would have to be under a pseudonym; I did not want to jeopardize a career by becoming known as a writer. I had heard the derisive references to "God-Is-My-Copilot" Scott. The ethic of fighter squadrons was drink and daring; anything else was suspect. Still, I thought of myself as more than just a pilot and imagined a book that would be in every way admirable. It would be evident that someone among the ranks of pilots had written it, an exceptional figure, unknown, but I would have the satisfaction of knowing who it was.</p> <p>I wrote when I could find time. Some of the book was written at a fighter base on Long Island, the rest of it in Europe, when I was stationed in Germany. A lieutenant in my squadron who lived in the apartment adjoining ours could hear the typewriter late at night through the bedroom wall. "What are you doing," he asked one day, "writing a book?" It was meant as a joke. Nothing could be more unlikely. I was the experienced operations officer. Next step was squadron commander.</p> <p><i>The Hunters</i> was published by Harper and Brothers in late 1956. A section of the book appeared first in <i>Collier's</i>. Word of it spread immediately. With the rest I sat speculating as to who the writer might be, someone who had served in Korea, with the Fourth Group, probably.</p> <p>The reviews were good. I was thirty-two years old, the father of a child, with my wife expecting another. I had been flying fighters for seven years. I decided I had had enough. The childhood urge to write had never died, in fact, it had proven itself. I discussed it with my wife, who, with only a partial understanding of what was involved, did not attempt to change my mind. Upon leaving Europe, I resigned my commission with the aim of becoming a writer.</p> <p>It was the most difficult act of my life. Latent in me, I suppose, there was always the belief that writing was greater than other things, or at least would prove to be greater in the end. Call it a delusion if you like, but within me was an insistence that whatever we did, the things that were said, the dawns, the cities, the lives, all of it had to be drawn together, made into pages, or it was in danger of not existing, of never having been. There comes a time when you realize that everything is a dream, and only those things preserved in writing have any possibility of being real.</p> <p>Of the actual hard business of writing I knew very little. The first book had been a gift. I missed the active life terribly, and after a long struggle a second book was completed. It was a failure. Jean Stafford, one of the judges for a prize for which it had been routinely submitted, left the manuscript on an airplane. The book made no sense to her, she said. But there was no turning back.</p> <p><i>A Sport and a Pastime</i> was published six years later. It, too, did not sell. A few thousand copies, that was all. It stayed in print, however, and one by one, slowly, foreign publishers bought it. Finally, Modern Library.</p> <p>The use of literature, Emerson wrote, is to afford us a platform whence we may command a view of our present life, a purchase by which we may move it. Perhaps this is true, but I would claim something broader. Literature is the river of civilization, its Tigris and Nile. Those who follow it, and I am inclined to say those only, pass by the glories.</p> <p>Over the years I have been a writer for a succession of reasons. In the beginning, as I have said, I wrote to be admired, even if not known. Once I had decided to be a writer, I wrote hoping for acceptance, approval.</p> <p>Gertrude Stein, when asked why she wrote, replied, "For praise." Lorca said he wrote to be loved. Faulkner said a writer wrote for glory. I may at times have written for those reasons, it's hard to know. Overall I write because I see the world in a certain way that no dialogue or series of them can begin to describe, that no book can fully render, though the greatest books thrill in their attempt.</p> <p>A great book may be an accident, but a good one is a possibility, and it is thinking of that that one writes. In short, to achieve. The rest takes care of itself, and so much praise is given to insignificant things that there is hardly any sense in striving for it.</p> <p>In the end, writing is like a prison, an island from which you will never be released but which is a kind of paradise: the solitude, the thoughts, the incredible joy of putting into words the essence of what you for the moment understand and with your whole heart want to believe.</p> <p><i>Why I Write: Thoughts on the Craft of Fiction</i><br> 1999</p></p><h2>Slide Rules: Their History, Models, and Makers</h2><p>In the hopes of &#34;preserving these delightful devices for future generations,&#34; this collector of slide rules covers everything one could possibly want to know about this crude form of analog computer: from its invention in the 17th century to manufacturers- retailers, 1850-1998, and the Oughtred Society for collectors.

Then suddenly, around 3000 B.C.E., the first of six great civilizations sprang up around the globe. All of them told creation myths in which gods came down to Earth, fashioned humans in their own image, and then taught them the arts of agriculture and civilized life. In addition, all these cultures--established in Egypt, Sumer, Peru, Mexico, China, and the Indus Valley--created mammoth pyramids, though science has never been able to explain how or where they obtained the advanced technological knowledge to construct these edifices. The abrupt appearance of these civilizations and the similarities of their development call into question the Darwinian theory of evolution--for there exists no trace of an intermediate Homo sapiens between these advanced people and the hunter-gatherer peoples who preceded them and who continued to live in other parts of the world as they had for thousands of years. <br> <br>Now, using the most current research on DNA; available archaeological, geodesic, and astronomical evidence; and a revolutionary analysis of the Book of Genesis, Will Hart makes the case that these gods were actually visitors from another world who genetically engineered modern humanity. Only now, at our current stage of development, are we ready to understand the information left behind in the ancient sites and mythology of these great civilizations--information that reveals the fate of humanity in the coming Earth changes. <br> <br>WILL HART is a journalist, photographer, and filmmaker who has been investigating ancient mysteries and evidence of extraterrestrial intervention on Earth since 1969.

It also is one of the most fascinating of all animals. For many people, the pronghorn was nearly as much a symbol of the American West as was the bison; for some, it still is. Eliminated from much of its historic range by the early 1900s, this unique North American big game species has experienced a remarkable recovery and now is found throughout the western United States, Canada, and northern Mexico. Thirty years in the making, <i>Pronghorn: Ecology and Management</i> contains the most comprehensive information on the behavior, physiology, migration, taxonomy, and management of this extraordinary animal.<br><br> Full chapters are devoted to distribution, nutrition and food, diseases and parasites, ecosystem management, hunting, and much more.

Two years later, Project Scoop sends seventeen satellites into the fringes of space in order to &#39;collect organisms and dust for study&#39;. Then a probe falls to the earth, landing in a desolate area of northeastern Arizona. A little while later, in the nearby town of Piedmont, bodies are discovered heaped and flung across the ground, faces locked in frozen surprise. The terror has begun...</p><p>Some biologists speculate that if we ever make contact with extraterrestrials, those life forms are likely to be--like most life on earth--one-celled or smaller creatures, more comparable to bacteria than little green men. And even though such organisms would not likely be able to harm humans, the possibility exists that first contact might be our last.<p> That's the scientific supposition that Michael Crichton formulates and follows out to its conclusion in his excellent debut novel, <i>The Andromeda Strain</i>. </p><p>A Nobel-Prize-winning bacteriologist, Jeremy Stone, urges the president to approve an extraterrestrial decontamination facility to sterilize returning astronauts, satellites, and spacecraft that might carry an "unknown biologic agent." The government agrees, almost too quickly, to build the top-secret Wildfire Lab in the desert of Nevada. Shortly thereafter, unbeknownst to Stone, the U.S. Army initiates the "Scoop" satellite program, an attempt to actively collect space pathogens for use in biological warfare. When Scoop VII crashes a couple years later in the isolated Arizona town of Piedmont, the Army ends up getting more than it asked for.</p><p> <i>The Andromeda Strain</i> follows Stone and rest of the scientific team mobilized to react to the Scoop crash as they scramble to understand and contain a strange and deadly outbreak.

He has contributed chapters on the subject to several academic books and he has made a special study of the career of the French First World War general Charles Mangin. His book The French Army&#39;s Tank Force and the Development of Armoured Warfare in the Great War was published in 2013."There is no doubt that it was the British who were the first to present a practical tank to the battlefield in 1916. However, it was the French who took the concept to the next level thanks to the revolutionary Renault FT-17, which was the first production tank to have it's main armament contained within a fully rotating turret; a system that remains in place to this day. Tim Gale's book fills a gap in the history of the First World War which, up until now, has only been available in detail, in French language tomes. Beginning with the formation of The 'Artillerie Special', the book takes us through the major battles involving French tanks, such as the Nivelle Offensive, Battle of Malmaison, Matz and Soissons up to the Armistice. Gale's book maybe text heavy, with only 16 black and white plates, a few pages of diagrams and plans to break it up but this does not detract from the fact that it is very easy to dip into... highly recommend to all early tank fans."

With many leading sustainability thinkers peppering the pages of this tome and providing many valuable insights, <i>The Post Carbon Reader</i> is definitely worth the read."--Erik Assadourian, Senior Fellow, Worldwatch Institute and Project Director of <i>State of the World 2010: Transforming Cultures: From Consumerism To Sustainability</i><br><br>"This is one of the best readers that I have seen in my 48 years as a university professor.

I plan to use it again next year when I teach Environmental Sociology."--Al Williams, Professor Emeritus, Department of Sociology, University of Nebraska<br><br>"I use various portions of <i>The Post Carbon Reader</i> in all my classes, and I reference it in my public presentations. I also note to all my undergrads doing senior projects, and graduate and doctoral students, that they need to read <i>The Post Carbon Reader</i>"-- Bob Scarfo, Associate Professor, Washington State University, Spokane<br><br>"I used quite a few chapters from <i>The Post Carbon Reader</i>. I very much appreciate its forward-thinking orientation as students in Environmental Studies classes too often get overwhelmed with all the facts about how we've messed up the environment. The Reader allows students to see that there are visionary thinkers trying not only to construct blueprints of what a post-carbon society might look like, but also the roadmaps for how to get there.

Not only does it treat the full range of topics one might anticipate, but it goes beyond the expected to offer original and creative insights regarding a venerable tradition of reflection upon life in society.

How and why did their culture achieve regional dominance?

Though quite simple, planes are enormously versatile and practical when skillfully used. The articles in this book, collected from <em>Fine</em> <em>Woodworking</em>, illustrate a host of topics, including basic plane operation, how to choose the right plane for the job, and specialty planes. Step-by-step instructions show how to build wooden planes - a popular project for hand tool fans - and how to correctly tune and sharpen, essential for proper plane operation.</p></p><p><i>Fine Woodworking </i>has been publishing the best woodworking information for small shop woodworkers since 1975.</p><h2>A Pelican in the Wilderness: Hermits, Solitaries, and Recluses</h2><p>From Lao-tse and the Buddha, St. Anthony and the early Celtic hermits, through Rousseau, Thoreau, Ruskin, and up to the present day, certain gifted persons have shown a vocation for living alone and apart, finding in simplicity and attention to nature a spiritual space to be explored and rejoiced in. Others, retreating from the world in scorn or cut off from it by scandal, have found that solitude is Hell, a pit of melancholy and morbid fancy. In this, her first work of nonfiction, novelist Isabel Colegate gives us the lives of the solitaries &#x2014; male and female, medieval and modern, divinely inspired and patently fraudulent. But this is no mere gallery of saints and sinners, poets and misanthropes. It is also a reevaluation of solitude for our times, and a reminder that it is in solitude that the soul meets itself, refreshes itself, and from there goes out to join the communal dance.</p><p>Isabel Colegate is author of fourteen previous books, including the celebrated novels Winter Journey and The Shooting Party.

Working here for two years as cabbie, caterer, and newspaper reporter, Conover serves up an enticing melange appropriate both for stargazers hooked on the lifestyles of the rich and famous and pop sociologists. Rubbing shoulders with people as diverse as John Denver, Hunter S. Thompson, New Age cultists, and a 1980s miner, he offers intriguing commentary on modern Aspen's change from a planned utopia, combining skiing with high culture, to a sybaritic playground.

In his new book, Griffin focuses on the fact that Sunstein&#39;s primary target is the conspiracy theory advocated by the 9/11 Truth Movement. Examining Sunstein&#39;s charge that this theory is both &#34;harmful&#34; and &#34;demonstrably false,&#34; Griffin uses both satire and overwhelming evidence to show that this twofold charge applies instead to what Sunstein calls &#34;the true conspiracy theory&#34; about 9/11�namely, the &#34;theory that al-Qaeda was responsible for 9/11.&#34;</p><p>David Ray Griffin is professor of philosophy of religion and theology, emeritus, at Claremont School of Theology and Claremont Graduate University in California. He is the author of over 30 books.&#34;In the United States today, the phrase `conspiracy theory&#39; functions as a sort of giant cudgel, used to scare us out of talking openly about a broad (and ever-growing) range of scandals that the powerful cannot afford to let the people comprehend. In this new book, David Ray Griffin takes devastating aim at that repressive tactic, exposing it for what it really is. All those who cherish democracy, and intellectual freedom, owe it to themselves to read this brave analysis---and owe its author their sincerest thanks.&#34; --- Mark Crispin Miller, Professor of Culture and Communication, New York University</p><h2>The Runaway Midwife: A Novel</h2><p><p>From the <em>USA Today</em> bestselling author of the Hope River series comes a new contemporary midwife novel.</p><p><strong>Say &#x201c;goodbye&#x201d; to your old life, and &#x201c;hello&#x201d; to the life you&#x2019;ve been waiting for...</strong><strong></strong></p><p>Midwife Clara Perry is accustomed to comforting her pregnant patients...calming fathers-to-be as they anxiously await the birth of their children...ensuring the babies she delivers come safely into the world.</p><p>But when Clara&#x2019;s life takes a nosedive, she realizes she hasn&#x2019;t been tending to her own needs and does something drastic: she runs away and starts over again in a place where no one knows her or the mess she&#x2019;s left behind in West Virginia.

While his recovery eludes him, his memory returns us to Minneapolis, to the Flats, a milling community on the Mississippi River, where Raimund and his brother Albert have sought respite from the oppressive hand of their older brother, now the master of the family farm and brewery. In Minnesota the brothers confront different forms of prejudice, but they also find a chance to remake their lives according to their own principles and wishes&#x2014;until the war makes their German roots inescapable.</p><p>Following these lives, <i>The Bohemian Flats</i> conjures both the sweep of irresistible history and the intimate reality of a man, and a family, caught up in it. From a nineteenth-century German farm to the thriving, wildly diverse immigrant village below Minneapolis on the Mississippi to the European front in World War I, and returning to twentieth-century America&#x2014;this is a story that takes a reader to the far reaches of human experience and the depths of the human heart. <br><br></p></p><p><p>Mary Relindes Ellis (1960&#x2013;2016) was the author of the novel <i>The Turtle Warrior</i>.</p>&nbsp;"<i>The Bohemian Flats</i>, bristling with historical detail, is a story about family members immigrating into the United States from Europe and settling in a unique district in Minneapolis."<br>&#x2014;David Rhodes, author of <i>Driftless</i> and <i>Jewelweed</i><br><br>"Ellis is a magician with historical details.

She was born in Sunderland, County Durham in 1916, but lived for most of her life in Scotland, a source of much inspiration for her writing. Her first novel,<i>Madam, Will You Talk?</i>was published in 1955 and marked the beginning of a long and acclaimed writing career. In 1971 she was awarded the International PEN Association's Frederick Niven Prize for<i>The Crystal Cave</i>, and in 1974 the Scottish Arts Council Award for one of her children's books,<i>Ludo and the Star Horse</i>. She was married to the Scottish geologist Frederick Stewart, and died in 2014.A comfortable chair and a Mary Stewart: total heaven.

J[n Kalman Stefnsson</h2><p>In a remote part of Iceland, a boy and his friend Barethur join a boat to fish for cod. A winter storm surprises them out at sea and Barethur, who has forgotten his waterproof as he was too absorbed in &#39;Paradise Lost&#39;, succumbs to the ferocious cold and dies. Appalled by the death and by the fishermen&#39;s callous ability to set about gutting the fatal catch, the boy leaves the village, intending to return the book to its owner. The extreme hardship and danger of the journey is of little consequence to him - he has already resolved to join his friend in death. But once in the town he immerses himself in the stories and lives of its inhabitants, and decides that he cannot be with his friend just yet. Set at the turn of the twentieth century, Heaven and Hell is a perfectly formed, vivid and timeless story, lyrical in style, and as intense a reading experience as the forces of the Icelandic landscape themselves. An outstandingly moving novel.</p><p>J n Kalman Stef nsson&#39;s novels have been nominated three times for the Nordic Council Prize for Literature and his novel Summer Light, and then Comes the Night received the Icelandic Prize for Literature in 2005. In 2011 he was awarded the prestigious P.O. Enquist Award. He is perhaps best known for his trilogy - Heaven and Hell, The Sorrow of Angels (longlisted for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize) and The Heart of Man (winner of the Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize) - and for Fish Have No Feet (longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize 2017).&#39;The author has a lyrical, poetic style ... the action unfolds vividly and dramatically, and the reader feels part of the scene.

"It's exactly what I had in mind."<br><br> "When you said something for Oktoberfest," Daisy said, "I wasn't sure whether to go with autumn, beer, or Germany, so I looked it up and incorporated all of them."<br><br> "Well, it's perfect."<br><br> Daisy clapped her hands together, making her blond braids sway. Her choice of hairstyle made her look fifteen instead of in her early thirties. "I'm so glad."<br><br> It really was perfect. She'd used the traditional Oktoberfest colors of blue and white. The centerpiece sample consisted of cream-colored silk mums and blue asters, and in the center was a miniature German beer stein. I'd ordered fourteen of them-enough to dress up all the tables in my brewpub. In two weeks, the Allegheny Brew House would be hosting its first Oktoberfest weekend.<br><br> Daisy came around the counter and took a seat on the other piano stool. "Explain one thing to me, Max. You're having this celebration in September. Shouldn't something called Oktoberfest happen in October?"<br><br> It was a common misconception. "The official Oktoberfest in Germany begins in mid-September and lasts for about two weeks. So it ends in October. Besides, Septemberfest doesn't have quite the same ring to it."<br><br> Daisy grinned. "No, it doesn't. How come you're wimping out and only having yours for a weekend?"<br><br> I laughed. "I'm having enough trouble coordinating everything for just the weekend. Do you know how hard it is to find an oompah band?"<br><br> "I never thought of that. But you did find one, right?"<br><br> "Yes," I said. "Candy, Kristie, and I are going to hear them play and make the final arrangements tonight. Why don't you come with us?"<br><br> "I don't know . . ."<br><br> "It'll be fun. A Friday girls' night out." I didn't add that she needed to get out and do something besides work on flower arrangements. She'd gone through a rough patch last spring when the man she'd been in love with had turned out to be someone who didn't care for her at all, and much worse. My insides still turned cold when I thought about what he'd done. Daisy had been devastated when she learned the truth and had even considered closing her shop and moving away. She was gradually becoming more like the old Daisy, but still had a little way to go.<br><br> She hesitated a moment, then said, "Maybe I will. It does sound like fun."<br><br> We talked for a few more minutes and decided I'd pick her up at eight. I was glad she'd agreed to go with us.<br><br> And it would be fun. Candy and Kristie would be sure to bring Daisy out of her self-imposed shell. Candy Sczypinski owned the bakery named Cupcakes N'at, which sat between the brewpub and Beautiful Blooms on Butler Street in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The name of the bakery usually confused visitors to the city, but Candy never seemed to tire of explaining that n'at was really a shortened form of and all that. It was one of the expresssions commonly known as Pittsburghese.<br><br> Candy was a Pittsburgher-or Yinzer as natives were sometimes called-through and through. I'd never seen her wear any colors but black and gold, and I always thought she looked like Mrs. Santa Claus in Steelers garb. Despite being in her early seventies, she had more energy than a twenty-year-old.<br><br> Kristie Brinkley was the owner and barista at Jump, Jive &amp; Java, the coffee shop across the street. She bore no resemblance to the supermodel, whose first name began with a C. Kristie looked more like Halle Berry, especially since she'd recently sheared off her dreadlocks and now only had a few streaks of purple in her hair. Purple this week anyway. She changed her hair color as often as some people changed their socks. I had a sneaking suspicion that her recent hairstyle change had something to do with the new love interest that she denied having. Candy was on the case, though. If anyone could discover who it was, she could.<br><br> As I passed the bakery on the way back to the brew house, Candy's assistant, Mary Louise, waved to me and I returned her wave. I was tempted to stop in for a treat, but I had a batch of stout in the brew kettle and it was time to get it ready for the fermentation tank. The Allegheny Brew House had been open since May, but I still got a thrill every time I neared the building. Its redbrick exterior with the large windows was exactly how I had pictured it would look when I bought the former office building of the defunct Steel City Brewery. It had been a true labor of love gutting and restoring the building. It hadn't been without its challenges and tragedies, but it was now everything I'd dreamed it would be.<br><br> Inside the pub, my staff was preparing for the lunch rush, and delicious aromas emanated from the kitchen. Nicole Clark, my part-time manager, was stacking glasses behind the polished dark oak bar, so I stopped to see her.<br><br> "Everything okay?" I asked.<br><br> "Yep." She nodded her head toward the brewery. "Need any help in there?"<br><br> Nicole was studying for her master's in chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, and she'd taken a shine to the brewing process. She reminded me a lot of myself, although I'd been more interested in distilling when I earned my degree. That had only changed to brewing when I made a trip to Germany.<br><br> "Sure, as long as I'm not taking you from anything else."<br><br> The brewery portion of the brew house was to my left. I had a 10-barrel or bbl system, which consisted of a mash tun to mash the malt grain, a brew kettle, and five fermentation tanks. In other words, I could brew approximately three hundred gallons at a time. It sounds like a lot of beer, but a half-barrel or keg holds around fifteen gallons, so that's only twenty kegs.<br><br> The aroma of caramel malt was strong, and I breathed in deeply as I went through the swinging door. Nicole was right behind me. She had been assisting me with brewing more and more lately. As much as I liked having the brewery to myself most of the time, I appreciated the help. And it was fun being on the teaching end for a change.<br><br> The next step in the process was to pump out the wort, which was the liquid formed from the mashed grain and water. Then we pumped it back into the brew kettle through a nozzle that forced the solids and hops to move into the center so when the tank was drained, the solids stayed. After that, we cooled the liquid quickly, added the yeast, and calculated the initial specific gravity. The initial gravity subtracted from the final gravity at the end of fermentation determined the ABV, or alcohol by volume-a very important number. By that time, it was the lunch hour, so Nicole returned to the pub while I finished transferring the stout to the fermentation tank. I set the temperature on the tank to sixty-eight degrees, where it would ferment for approximately two weeks.<br><br> My stomach was screaming for food by then, so I decided to get something to eat before I tackled the cleanup. Cleaning and sterilizing all the equipment took time, and I needed to be properly fortified first. Besides, I hadn't seen Jake yet this morning.<br><br> The thought of seeing my chef brought a smile to my face. I'd known Jake Lambert practically all my life. He'd been my brother Mike's best friend-and still was-and I'd had a crush on him for years. When my former chef, Kurt, had been murdered four months ago, Jake had walked back into my life. He'd just retired from playing professional hockey and happened to be a certified chef. One thing led to another and we were now what my mother called "an item."<br><br> I crossed the pine plank floor of the pub, stopping briefly to say hello to a few regulars. I liked that we had customers who kept coming back for the food as well as the beer. My stomach growled again as I went through the door to the kitchen. Two cooks plus Jake were in various stages of food preparation.<br><br> Jeannie Cross was assembling two grilled chicken salads and smiled when she noticed me. "Heads up, everyone. The boss is on deck."<br><br> "Uh-oh," Kevin Bruno said without glancing up from where he was saut&#x17d;ing some vegetables while simultaneously grilling burgers. "She must be hungry."<br><br> Jake was elbow deep in kneading some kind of dough. He looked up and winked at me. It never failed to make my stomach do that little flip and I felt my cheeks grow warm. "Either that, or she's here to fire your sorry behind," he said.<br><br> I laughed. I loved the camaraderie of my employees. They'd become my second family. "Don't worry, Kev. You're safe. As long as I get something to eat, that is."<br><br> Jake said, "Jeannie, fix Max one of those new turkey sandwiches we came up with." He held up his flour-covered arms. "I'd do it myself, but I'm a little indisposed."<br><br> "Coming right up." Jeannie put the finishing touch on the chicken salads by tossing a handful of French fries on top, which was a Pittsburgh tradition. I wasn't wild about it, but when customers kept asking for the fries, I gave in.<br><br> I followed her over to another stainless steel table, where she quickly assembled a sandwich on whole grain bread with roasted turkey slices, a thick slice of cheddar, baby spinach, and topped it with something that looked like a cranberry chutney or relish.<br><br> "Here you go, boss." She handed me the plate.<br><br> I took a bite. It was an interesting combination of flavors. The cheddar and turkey were familiar. The cranberry chutney was what made the sandwich. I tasted a hint of orange, and there was a little bit of heat to it also.<br><br> "Well?" Jeannie said.<br><br> "I like it. Especially the cranberries. I like the combination of sweet, tart, and heat." I swallowed the second bite. "I'm not sure about the spinach on here, though."<br><br> Jeannie looked smug. "That's what I told Jake."<br><br> Jake pushed the dough aside and went to the sink. "I guess I'm outnumbered-unless Kevin is going to back me up."<br><br> Kevin raised a hand. "I'm staying out of it. I don't even like cranberries."<br><br> I took my lunch to my office and finished the sandwich in record time, then buckled down to do some paperwork and make some calls. There was still a good bit that needed to be done for our Oktoberfest celebration. Jake had already come up with a special menu full of German food for that weekend-three kinds of wurst, schnitzel, sauerkraut, potato pancakes, and German potato salad. I made a note to pick up the menus at the print shop before the end of next week. I made a few phone calls, and after I updated my To Do list, I headed back to the brewery to clean up. A brewer's work is never done.<br><br> The fire hall hosting the band I was hiring for our celebration was located just north of the city. Kristie drove, Candy rode shotgun, and Daisy and I white-knuckled it in the back. Kristie should have been a NASCAR driver. Thank goodness it was a short trip. I was tempted to make the Sign of the Cross when she screeched into the last empty parking space in the lot. I heard Daisy blow out air. She must have been holding her breath. Candy, however, didn�t seem to be fazed one bit by Kristie�s driving. Then again, I�d been a passenger in Candy�s car. She drove as if the streets were an obstacle course.<br><br> The sound of accordion and horn music drifted across the lot when we got out of the car. "This is going to be so much fun," Candy said. Tonight she wore her best black and gold sequined blouse, black pants, and gold ballet flats. "It's been years since I heard this kind of music. It really takes me back."<br><br> "Back where?" I asked. I was constantly trying to get her to spill something about her background.<br><br> "To my much younger days." She turned to Daisy. "I'm so glad you decided to come with us."<br><br> Daisy smiled. "I am, too."<br><br> By this time we were at the door. Two women were seated at a table with a steel cashbox and took our ten-dollar admission fees. There was a large sign welcoming us to their Octoberfest. I decided it wouldn't be polite to point out that they were a little early, or that they'd misspelled it by using a C instead of a K. It gave me a bad feeling about the beer they'd be serving.<br><br> The hall was decorated with black, red, and yellow streamers that matched the tiny German flags on every table. Not exactly the traditional Oktoberfest colors. Daisy caught my eye and made a face. I smiled at her and shrugged. At least they had the German part right.<br><br> Kristie pointed toward the far side of the hall. "There are some empty seats over there." We followed her across the room and sat at the end of a large banquet table. "I'm buying tonight," she hollered over the din. "What's everyone drinking?"<br><br> Daisy only wanted bottled water and Candy said she'd have the same. I offered to help Kristie and we headed to the bar. I was surprised at the assortment of beverages on hand, and especially that they had bottles of Oktoberfest beer from a local brewery. That moved them up a notch in my eyes. Despite the selection, Kristie and I also chose water for now.<br><br> It was too noisy in the hall for much conversation-especially with the band playing-so we sat and listened. The Deutschmen were very good, and hearing them play again made me glad I'd decided to hire them. The four musicians played accordion, trumpet, keyboard, and a sousaphone. I had to admit I'd never seen a sousaphone except in a marching band. I thought it an odd choice when a tuba would have worked just as well-or better. Plus it wouldn't have taken up half the stage.<br><br> There were only two couples on the dance floor until the band broke out in their version of the "Steeler Polka," which was sung to the tune of the "Pennsylvania Polka." A dozen people jumped to their feet, including Candy. She grabbed my hand. "Come on. You're dancing with me."<br><br> I tried to pull my hand back with no luck. "I don't know how to polka. I'm Irish. O'Haras don't polka."</p><h2>Destiny of Islam in the End Times: Understanding God&#39;s Heart for the Muslim People</h2><p><p>Faisal Malick knows how Muslims think, why they act, and what they feel.

Norton saw more action during the conflict than almost anyone else, being present at the fall of Detroit, the capture of Fort Niagara, the battles of Queenston Heights, Fort George, Stoney Creek, Chippawa, and Lundy&#x2019;s Lane, the blockades of Fort George and Fort Erie, as well as a large number of skirmishes and front-line patrols.

With the assistance of modern scholarship, <em>A Mohawk Memoir</em> presents an exceptional opportunity to explore the War of 1812 and native-newcomer issues through Teyoninhokarawen&#x2019;s Mohawk perspectives from a period that produced few indigenous autobiographies, of which Norton&#x2019;s is the most extensive, engaging, and reliable.</p></p><p><b>Carl Benn</b> is a history professor at Ryerson University.

In his search for insights into Sodo Yokoyama&#x2019;s life, Arthur Braverman skillfully weaves a tapestry from seemingly disparate threads&#x2015;the brief <em>taisho</em> period into which Sodo-san was born and where individualism shone; his teachers, both ancient and contemporary practitioners of Zen Bhuddism; the monk&#x2019;s love of baseball; and the similarities Braverman finds between Sodo-san and Walt Whitman, who both found the universal in nature.<br><br>Through conversations with Joko Shibata, Yokoyama&#x2019;s sole disciple, and careful study of his teacher&#x2019;s poetry, an intriguing tension between the personal and the universal is revealed. <br><br><em>The Grass Flute Zen Master</em> is a meditative examination not of just one life, but of many. The lineage of teacher and prot�g� is traced back through generations, contemporaries are drawn up from unexpected places, and Braverman examines his own long journey in Zen Buddhism; confronting his own expectations and surprising disappointments (the monk lived in a boarding house and later took a cab to his park when he could no longer walk the whole way) and the understanding and acceptance that followed. &#x201c;When you play the leaf,&#x201d; Sodo-san once wrote, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll usually be a little out of tune.

With his independent spirit and dedication to Buddha nature, Bassui managed to bridge and include several prominent strands of Zen and Japanese Buddhism. His teachings demonstrate persistent study of true self, right in the mud of phenomena. He drinks the water of diverse Dharma teachings, helpfully elucidating their metaphors for us.&#x201d; Taigen Dan Leighton, author of <i>Bodhisattva Archtypes</i> and translator, <i>Cultivating the Empty Field</i><br><br><b>Praise for <i>Warrior of Zen: The Diamond-Hard Wisdom Mind of Suzuki Shosan</i></b><br><br> Zen has often been saddled with the belief that only quiet contemplation and inactivity can lead the practitioner to enlightenment. This work is a welcome counterpoint to this belief. Suzuki Shosan, a samurai warrior under the Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, became a Zen monk and brought to Zen an active philosophy. He believed that a warrior's life was well suited to Zen because both demanded vitality, active belief, courage, and what he called "death energy"-the readiness to confront death at any moment. This book contains selections of the Roankyo, talks given by Suzuki Shosan to his students. The editor/translator does a good job of maintaining the colloquial atmosphere of the original text; he allows the teachings to speak for themselves. This book is a good introduction for the English-reading world to a long-neglected variation of Zen philosophy.

So awesome in its portrayal that no painting, no writing, no leap of the imagination compares with this supernal presentation of Gene Edwards's portrait of Christ's coming. <br>Until now, all books about Christ's return have ended with His coming. Never before has any author ventured into the mysteries of what happens after the Lord returns to heaven with the redeemed. The greast glory begins there. You will be present when the elect angels drive the rebellious angels into eternal oblivion. Watch as Lucifer finally falls on his face and confesses that Jesus is Lord. Then, at last, Jesus heaves Death into the fiery pit and Death himself dies. Finally, in the most spectacular finale of all grand finales, Jesus takes to Himself His Bride...the most beautiful woman ever to be known. The Return is a tapestry of sheer glory that allows you to be there at the end of all things. Do not miss Christ's return...and beyond!</p><p></p><h2>The World&#39;s Greatest Fake Book</h2><p>Sher Music&#39;s first fake book was designed to include all the best original jazz compositions not included in the old, illegal Real Book.

Her debut novel, Carry Me Home, was a Book Sense Notable pick and a 2005 Midwest Booksellers&#39; Choice Award nominee.1<br><br> I should have known that summer of 1961 was gonna be the biggest summer of our lives. I should have known it the minute I saw Freeda Malone step out of that pickup, her hair lit up in the sun like hot flames. I should have known it, because Uncle Rudy told me what happens when a wildfire comes along.<br><br> We were standing in his yard, Uncle Rudy and I, at the foot of a red pine that seemed to stretch to heaven, when a squirrel began knocking pinecones to the ground with soft thuds. Uncle Rudy bent over with a grunt and picked one of the green cones up, rolling it a bit in his callused palm before handing it to me. It was cool in my hands. Sap dripped down the side like tears.<br><br> &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s somethin&#x2019; I bet you don&#x2019;t know, Button,&#x201d; he said, using the nickname he himself gave me. &#x201c;That cone there, it ain&#x2019;t like the cones of most other trees. Most cones, all they need is time, or a squirrel to crack &#x2019;em open so they can drop their seeds and start a new tree. But that cone there, it ain&#x2019;t gonna open up and drop its seeds unless a wildfire comes through here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A wildfire?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Uncle Rudy said, scraping the scalp under his cap with his dirty fingernail. &#x201c;See them little scales there, how they&#x2019;re closed up tight like window shutters? Under- neath &#x2019;em are the seeds&#x2014;flat little things, flimsy as a baby&#x2019;s fingernails&#x2014;with a point at one end. If a fire comes along, the heat is gonna cause those scales to peel back and drop their seeds, while the ground is still scorching hot. Then that tiny seed is gonna burrow in and take root.&#x201d;<br><br> I was nine years old the summer Freeda and Winnalee Malone rushed across our lives like red-hot flames, peeling back the shutters that sat over our hearts and our minds, setting free our sweetest dreams and our worst nightmares. Too young to know at the onset that anything out of the ordinary was about to happen.<br><br> I was sitting on my knees behind the counter at The Corner Store playing with my new Barbie doll, her tiny outfits lined up on the scuffed linoleum. It was the first day of summer vacation, and Aunt Verdella was watching me because my ma was working for Dr. Wagner, the dentist, taking appointments and sending out bills and stuff like that. Aunt Verdella didn&#x2019;t work, like my ma, but she&#x2019;d been filling in at the store for Ada Smithy (who was having a recuperation from an opera- tion, because she&#x2019;d had some ladies&#x2019; troubles). It was Aunt Verdella&#x2019;s last day, then Ada was coming back, and we could stay at Aunt Verdella&#x2019;s while she looked after me.<br><br> Aunt Verdella was standing next to me, the hem of her dress like a blue umbrella above me. She was talking to Fanny Tilman about Ada, and Aunt Verdella&#x2019;s voice sounded almost like it was crying when she said, &#x201c;Such a pity, such a pity,&#x201d; and Fanny Tilman asked her what the pity was for, anyway. &#x201c;Ada&#x2019;s well past her prime, so seems to me that not getting the curse from here on out should be more of a blessing than a pity,&#x201d; she said, and Aunt Verdella said, &#x201c;But still . . .&#x201d;<br><br> While they talked, I was trying to get Barbie&#x2019;s tweed jacket on, which wasn&#x2019;t easy because her elbows didn&#x2019;t bend, and that tiny hand of hers kept snagging on the sleeve. While I was tugging, I was itching. I was looking at the little clothes spread out and trying hard to remember if she was supposed to wear the red jacket with the brown skirt or the green skirt. I cleared my throat a few times, like I always did when I didn&#x2019;t know what I was supposed to do next, and Aunt Verdella looked down at me. &#x201c;Button, you&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; that thing with your throat again. What&#x2019;s the matter, honey?&#x201d; Aunt Verdella&#x2019;s voice was loud, so loud that sometimes it pained my ears when she wasn&#x2019;t even yelling, and her body always reminded me of a snowman made with two balls instead of three. The littlest ball was her head, sitting right on top of one big, fat ball.<br><br> I stood up. My knees felt gritty and I glanced down at them, hoping they weren&#x2019;t getting too dirty, because I knew Ma&#x2019;s lips were gonna pull so tight they&#x2019;d turn white, like they always did when Aunt Verdella brought me home looking all grubby. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get her jacket on,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> I handed Aunt Verdella my Barbie, the tweed jacket flapping at her back. Aunt Verdella laughed as she took it. Fanny Tilman peered at me, her puffy eyes puckering. &#x201c;Is that Reece and Jewel&#x2019;s little one?&#x201d; she said, like Aunt Verdella could hear her but I couldn&#x2019;t. I put my head down and stared at a gouge in the gray countertop.<br><br> &#x201c;Yep, this is our Button,&#x201d; Aunt Verdella said. She wrapped her freckly arm&#x2014;stick-skinny like her legs&#x2014;around me and pulled me to her biggest ball. It was soft and warm, not snowman-cold at all.<br><br> &#x201c;She looks like Jewel,&#x201d; Mrs. Tilman said, and she sounded a bit sorry about this. I saw her looking at my ears, which were too big for my head, and the face she made made me feel smaller than I already was. Aunt Verdella thought that long hair would hide my ears until I grew into them, but Ma said long hair was too much work to keep neat and she already had enough to do. Every couple of months, she&#x2019;d snip it short, thin it with those scissors that have missing teeth, then curl it with a Tony perm. When she was done, my hair was bunched up in ten or eleven little pale brown knots. I wanted hair long enough to hang loose past my shoulders and cover my ears when I was around people, and to put up in a ponytail that swished my back when I wasn&#x2019;t. But, shoot, I knew I&#x2019;d never have anything but those stubby knots.<br><br> Aunt Verdella finished dressing Barbie, then handed her to me. I stood there a minute, wanting to ask her which skirt matched, but I didn&#x2019;t want to talk with Fanny Tilman still looking at me, so I sat back down on the linoleum and stared at the two skirts some more.<br><br> Aunt Verdella had the door propped open with a big rock, because it was nice outside and the store was too hot with the sun beating through the windows. I was staring at the doll clothes when the sound of metal scraping on pavement filled the store.<br><br> &#x201c;Uh-oh, somebody&#x2019;s losing their muffler,&#x201d; Aunt Verdella said. The racket from the scraping muffler got louder and sharper before it came to a stop. Aunt Verdella got up on her tiptoes, the tops of her white shoes making folds like Uncle Rudy&#x2019;s forehead did when she brought home a whole trunkload of junk from the community sale.<br><br> &#x201c;Good Lord, look what the cat&#x2019;s drug into town now,&#x201d; Fanny Tilman said. &#x201c;Just what we need, a band of gypsies.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, Fanny!&#x201d; Aunt Verdella said.<br><br> I heard a door creak open, then slam shut. A lady&#x2019;s voice started talking, but I couldn&#x2019;t make out what it was saying. I heard some banging and then, &#x201c;Jesus H. Christ! Is anybody gonna come pump my gas or not?&#x201d; Folks who got gas at The Corner Store pumped their own gas, except for a couple of old ladies and the outsiders. Aunt Verdella called out, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right there, dear!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Excuse me, Button,&#x201d; she said as she stepped over me and hurried around the counter. I put my fingertips on the counter and pulled myself up to take a peek. Mrs. Tilman was standing in the open doorway, her purse clutched in her arms like she thought the &#x201c;gypsies&#x201d; were going to try swiping it. She was busy gawking, so I stood all the way up and peeked out between the handmade signs Scotch-taped to the window.<br><br> The bed of the red pickup truck at the pumps, and the wagon towed behind it, were piled high with junky furniture I knew didn&#x2019;t match and boxes stuffed with bunched-up clothes and dishes that spilled out over the tops.<br><br> My eyes almost bugged out of my head when I saw the lady who was standing next to the truck while Aunt Verdella pumped her gas. She had the prettiest color hair I&#x2019;d ever seen. Red, but like a red I&#x2019;d never set eyes on before: shiny like a pot of melted copper pennies. Not dark, not light, but somewhere in between, and bright like fire. She stretched like a cat, the sleeveless blouse tied at her waist riding up a belly that was flat and the color of buttered toast. She was made like my Barbie doll, with two big bumps under her blouse, a skinny waist, and long legs under kelly-green pedal pushers. She was wearing a pair of sunglasses with a row of rhinestones at the corners that shot rays into my eyes when she turned toward the store. There was something about the lady, too, that shined just as bright as her hair and those rhinestones. Not a warm kind of shining, but a sharp kind, like bright sun jabbing through the window and stinging your eyes.<br><br> Aunt Verdella cranked her head toward the store and yelled, &#x201c;Button, bring Auntie the restroom key, will ya?&#x201d;<br><br> I stepped up on the wooden stool and reached for the key, which was taped to a ruler so it couldn&#x2019;t get lost easy, and I hurried it outside. As much as I hated meeting new people, I wanted to see the pretty lady up close.<br><br> The Barbie lady took off her sunglasses and poked them into her fiery hair, which was piled high on her head in a messy sort of way. She had green eyes like a cat&#x2019;s, and her eyelids were sparkly with the same color, clear up to her eyebrows. She had real nice ears too. Tiny, and laying flat to her head like ears are supposed to. I handed Aunt Verdella the key, and she gave it to the pretty lady, who was glaring at the truck, a crabby look on her face. &#x201c;The ladies&#x2019; restroom is right around the west side of the building, honey,&#x201d; Aunt Verdella told her.<br><br> The pretty lady tapped the ruler against her thigh. &#x201c;Winnalee Malone, I&#x2019;m gonna blister your ass if you don&#x2019;t get out of that truck this instant and go pee. You hear me?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d never heard a lady swear before, so I know my eyes must have stretched as big as my ears.<br><br> The windshield of the truck was blue-black in the sun, so I couldn&#x2019;t see who she was talking to. Aunt Verdella put the gas handle back onto the hook alongside the pump, then headed over to the driver&#x2019;s door where the Barbie lady was standing, still tapping the ruler on her leg. &#x201c;Oh my,&#x201d; Aunt Verdella said. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t you the prettiest little thing! You&#x2019;ve got a face like a cherub.&#x201d; Aunt Verdella said &#x201c;cherub&#x201d; more like &#x201c;cherry-up.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you come out here and say hello? I got Popsicles inside. A free one for the first pretty little customer who uses the restroom today.&#x201d; Aunt Verdella looked at the lady and winked, then turned back to the truck. &#x201c;Come on, now, honey. We don&#x2019;t bite.&#x201d;<br><br> The Barbie lady lifted her arms and slapped them against the sides of her thighs. &#x201c;Ah, to hell with you, Winnalee. If you&#x2019;re gonna be stubborn, then sit there till your bladder bursts, for all I care. I&#x2019;m too tired to argue with you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Winnalee? Now, ain&#x2019;t that the prettiest name. Where&#x2019;d you get a pretty name like that?&#x201d; Aunt Verdella asked.<br><br> &#x201c;From my ma,&#x201d; said a voice from inside the truck. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a homemade name.&#x201d;<br><br> The lady cussed again, like ladies aren&#x2019;t supposed to do, then she said, &#x201c;Winnalee, I&#x2019;m not going to stand here and piss my pants waiting for you. You coming or not?&#x201d;<br><br> Aunt Verdella cranked her head around. &#x201c;You go on to the restroom, dear. I got a way with children,&#x201d; she said, then she winked again. The pretty lady made a growly sound in her throat, then she headed toward the building, her heels clacking against the pavement.<br><br> It took a while, but finally Aunt Verdella coaxed Winnalee out. When I saw her, I could hardly believe my eyes: She had long, loopy hair the color of that stringy part inside a cob of corn, but with some yellow mixed in too, and it hung clear down to her butt. It didn&#x2019;t have any rubber bands or barrettes in it, so it floated in the breeze like a mermaid&#x2019;s hair under water. Her face was round and pink, with little lips that looked like they had lipstick on them. She was wearing a lady&#x2019;s mesh slip, and it was rolled up at her round belly to keep it from falling down. She had on a white sleeveless blouse that belonged on a grown-up too. One side of it slipped down her arm and she crooked her elbow to keep it from falling all the way off. She didn&#x2019;t look at us but turned to reach for something on the seat. I scootched over by Aunt Verdella to see what the mermaid girl was getting.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, my, what do you have there, Winnalee?&#x201d; Aunt Verdella asked as the girl slid out of the truck holding a capped, shiny silver vase in her arms, cradling it like it was a baby doll.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my ma,&#x201d; Winnalee said.<br><br> &#x201c;Your ma?&#x201d; Aunt Verdella asked, suddenly looking a bit shook up.<br><br> It was like Aunt Verdella didn&#x2019;t know what to say&#x2014;which I was sure was because she was thinking the same thought as me. That there wasn&#x2019;t a lady anywhere small enough to fit into that vase. Either Winnalee was funning us, or else she was just plain nuts. Instead, Aunt Verdella asked her about the thick book she had tucked under her armpit. &#x201c;Button likes to read big books too, don&#x2019;t you Button?&#x201d; she said, putting an arm around me.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s her Book of Bright Ideas,&#x201d; said a voice behind us in the same tone that the snotty big kids who picked on us little kids at recess used. I turned and saw the pretty lady standing there, her hands on her hips, her legs parted. She was looking up and down the street.<br><br> It was like Aunt Verdella didn&#x2019;t know what to say again, so she said nothing except that if Winnalee was a good little girl and went potty, she&#x2019;d give her a Popsicle or an ice cream bar.<br><br> The lady grabbed a big black purse off of the seat of the truck and we all headed toward the store, Winnalee&#x2019;s loopy hair dancing, her mesh slip flapping in the breeze like fins.<br><br> Fanny Tilman backed out of the doorway and slipped behind a grocery shelf, where I knew she was gonna stay hid, like a mouse waiting for somebody to drop some crumbs.<br><br> &#x201c;Where you people from?&#x201d; Aunt Verdella asked as she scooted behind the counter. The pretty lady took a bottle of RC Cola and one of root beer from the cooler, then set them down on the counter alongside her purse. Winnalee was behind her.<br><br> &#x201c;Gary,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Gary, Indiana. We drove straight through.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Winnalee said. &#x201c;We had to leave in the middle of the night. All because Freeda went dancing with some guy from the meat factory, when she was supposed to be Harley Hoffesteader&#x2019;s girl. Harley got so pissed he was coming after her with a shotgun. Probably would have killed both of us dead if we hadn&#x2019;t gotten out of there fast. It don&#x2019;t matter, though. Freeda would&#x2019;ve moved us anyways. She always does.&#x201d; The lady cuffed her on the top of her head and Winnalee cried out, &#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d; Aunt Verdella flinched and told Winnalee that maybe she should go potty now, and would she like me or her to go with her. Winnalee&#x2019;s nose crinkled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a baby,&#x201d; she said, then she grabbed the key from the counter and marched out the door.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh my. Gary. That&#x2019;s quite a drive. That must be, what, a good three fifty, four hundred miles from here?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Freeda shook her head so that wispy strands wobbled against her long neck. &#x201c;Hell, I don&#x2019;t even know where we are.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in Dauber, Wisconsin, dear. Population 3,263,&#x201d; Aunt Verdella said proudly. &#x201c;You thinking of settling here, or are you just passing through?&#x201d;<br><br> Freeda shrugged. &#x201c;I guess one place is as good as another. There any places to rent around here?&#x201d;<br><br> I swear I heard Fanny Tilman (who was peeking up over the bread rack) gasp.<br><br> Aunt Verdella squeaked her tongue against her teeth as she thought. Then her puffy lips made a circle like a doughnut. &#x201c;Ohhhh, well, actually, there just might be! Well, if you don&#x2019;t mind living in a place that&#x2019;s being fixed up, that is. You see, my husband, Rudy, and his brother, Reece, their ma passed away a couple a years ago, and we&#x2019;ve been talking about renting her place out once Reece gets it fixed up.

As children Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy were students at Hailsham, an exclusive boarding school secluded in the English countryside. It was a place of mercurial cliques and mysterious rules where teachers were constantly reminding their charges of how special they were. <br>Now, years later, Kathy is a young woman. Ruth and Tommy have reentered her life. And for the first time she is beginning to look back at their shared past and understand just what it is that makes them special and how that gift will shape the rest of their time together. Suspenseful, moving, beautifully atmospheric, Never Let Me Go" "is another classic by the author of The Remains of the Day."</p><p>All children should believe they are special. But the students of Hailsham, an elite school in the English countryside, are so special that visitors shun them, and only by rumor and the occasional fleeting remark by a teacher do they discover their unconventional origins and strange destiny. Kazuo Ishiguro's sixth novel, <i>Never Let Me Go</i>, is a masterpiece of indirection. Like the students of Hailsham, readers are "told but not told" what is going on and should be allowed to discover the secrets of Hailsham and the truth about these children on their own.<p> Offsetting the bizarreness of these revelations is the placid, measured voice of the narrator, Kathy H., a 31-year-old Hailsham alumna who, at the close of the 1990s, is consciously ending one phase of her life and beginning another. She is in a reflective mood, and recounts not only her childhood memories, but her quest in adulthood to find out more about Hailsham and the idealistic women who ran it. Although often poignant, Kathy's matter-of-fact narration blunts the sharper emotional effects you might expect in a novel that deals with illness, self-sacrifice, and the severe restriction of personal freedoms. As in Ishiguro's best-known work, <i>The Remains of the Day</i>, only after closing the book do you absorb the magnitude of what his characters endure. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Remains of the Day and When We Were Orphans, comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means to be human. <br>Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it. <br>Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it's only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is. <br>Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Praying the Promises of the Bible: A Prayer Journal to Strengthen Your Faith</h2><p><b>Claim God's Promises as Your Very Own in This Beautiful Prayer Journal</b><br><br> The Bible is full of God's promises--blessings from His heart straight to the lives of His children. <i>Praying the Promises of the Bible</i> is a prayer journal that claims these scriptural promises in a new, personal way.<br><br> More than 350 original prayers are arranged in dozens of practical and encouraging topics--from Compassion and Forgiveness to Pride and Repentance.

The works of Zola, Tolstoy, P�rez Gald�s, and George Eliot are in the most profound sense inimitable, yet continue to dominate the novel form to this day. Novels to emerge since struggle to reconcile the social conditions of their own creation with the history of this mode of writing: the so-called modernist novel is one attempted solution to this conflict, as is the ever-more impoverished variety of commercial narratives&nbsp;&#x2013;&nbsp;what today&#x2019;s book reviewers dub &#x201c;serious novels,&#x201d; which are an attempt at the impossible endeavor to roll back the past.&nbsp;<br><br> Fredric Jameson examines the most influential theories of artistic and literary realism, approaching the subject himself in terms of the social and historical preconditions for realism&#x2019;s emergence. The realist novel combined an attention to the body and its states of feeling with a focus on the quest for individual realization within the confines of history.&nbsp;<br><br>In contemporary writing, other forms of representation &#x2013;&nbsp;for which the term &#x201c;postmodern&#x201d; is too glib&nbsp;&#x2013;&nbsp;have become visible: for example, in the historical fiction of Hilary Mantel or the stylistic plurality of David Mitchell&#x2019;s novels. Contemporary fiction is shown to be conducting startling experiments in the representation of new realities of a global social totality, modern technological warfare, and historical developments that, although they saturate every corner of our lives, only become apparent on rare occasions and by way of the strangest formal and artistic devices.<br><br>In a coda, Jameson explains how &#x201c;realistic&#x201d; narratives survived the end of classical realism. In effect, he provides an argument for the serious study of popular fiction and mass culture that transcends lazy journalism and the easy platitudes of recent cultural studies.</p><p><b>Fredric Jameson</b> is Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature at Duke University. The author of numerous books, he has over the last three decades developed a richly nuanced vision of Western culture&#x2019;s relation to political economy. He was a recipient of the 2008 Holberg International Memorial Prize. He is the author of many books, including <i>Postmodernism, Or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism</i>;<i> The Cultural Turn</i>; <i>A Singular Modernity</i>; <i>The Modernist Papers</i>; <i>Archaeologies of the Future</i>; <i>Brecht and Method</i>; <i>Ideologies of Theory</i>; <i>Valences of the Dialectic</i>; <i>The Hegel Variations</i>; and <i>Representing Capital</i>.&#x201c;Manifestly displays Jameson&#x2019;s many virtues as a truly great critic ... It is not always easy to read the work of someone who just won&#x2019;t sit on his laurels: but in this case it is worth it.&#x201d; &#x2014;Robert Eaglestone, <i>Times Higher Education</i><br><br> &#x201c;This latest installment in his epic &#x2018;poetics of social form&#x2019; is vintage Jameson: no other critic has his range of reference in literature and theory, and no one dialecticizes their connections to politics and history with anything like his transformative energy. Not since Auerbach has &#x2018;realism&#x2019; been so penetratingly analyzed or so radically rethought. With many surprises along the way &#x2013;&nbsp;such as the new centrality Jameson affords &#x2018;affect&#x2019; in the realist novel&nbsp;&#x2013;&nbsp;the results are absolutely stunning.&#x201d; &#x2014;Hal Foster, Princeton University<br><br> &#x201c;Admirable ...

Six months later they lay dead aboard their boat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Larry&#x2019;s younger brother became the prime suspect in the FBI&#x2019;s murder investigation. But federal prosecutors never indicted him, leaving the case unresolved and splitting the Edwards family into feuding factions.Three decades later, a dispute over how to respond to a true-crime book by Ann Rule&#x2014;which contained an inaccurate account of the case&#x2014;ripped the tattered family even farther apart.In &#x201c;Dare I Call It Murder?,&#x201d; Larry Edwards sets the record straight, revealing previously undisclosed facts from the investigation as he lays out the case never presented in court.Larry&#x2019;s memoir, however, goes beyond simply telling the untold story of his parents&#x2019; deaths and refuting the errors in previously published material. His broader goal is to see the book generate greater awareness of and conversations about violent loss, its impact on the survivors and their families, and the troubling effects of post-traumatic stress (PTSD).WINNER: San Diego Book Awards, 2012 (unpublished memoir)."

Far from being a novelty, each book is a highly refined appraisal of the philosopher and his work, authoritative and clearly presented.</p><p>In earlier centuries philosophy had been dangerous for philosophers; with Friedrich Nietzsche it becomes dangerous for everyone. Nietzsche ended up by going mad, but his ideas presaged a collective madness which was to have horrific consequences in Europe during the first half of the twentieth century. His philosophy is one of aphorisms and penetrating psychological insights, not a system. But it is as brilliant, persuasive, and incisive as any before or since. His major concept is the Will to Power, which he saw as the basic impulse for all our acts. Christianity he saw as a subtle perversion of this concept - thus Nietzsche&#39;s famous pronouncement, &#34;God is dead&#34;. In Nietzsche in 90 Minutes, Paul Strathern offers a concise, expert account of Nietzsche&#39;s life and ideas, and explains their influence on man&#39;s struggle to understand his existence in the world. The book also includes selections from Nietzsche&#39;s work; a brief list of suggested reading for those who wish to push further; and chronologies that place Nietzsche within his own age and in the broader scheme of philosophy.Paul Strathern is author of the popular and critically acclaimed Philosophers in 90 Minutes series. Highlights from the series include <i>Nietzsche in 90 Minutes, Aristotle in 90 Minutes</i>, and <i>Plato in 90 Minutes</i>.

A former Somerset Maugham prize winner, he is also the author of books on history and travel as well as five novels.

This ninth posthumous volume of new verse (following <i>Slouching Toward Nirvana</i> closely) gathers everything devotees cherish and expect: horses and bets, lousy SROs, unreliable women, sexual conquests, sexual disgust, barbs at highbrow rivals, advice to so-called losers (as he once was) to have confidence in themselves (as he did) and a befuddled acceptance of late fame. "Welcome to my wormy hell," the first line in the volume reads, and similar notes of not-quite-comic self-pity occur throughout, as when "the x-bum" reminds himself "that there was no bottom to life." These poems differ little from those in his other late volumes and may not win him many new fans: given the size of his existing following, however, this book won't need new ones. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The &#x201c;Covenants Initiative&#x201d; within the book represents a movement by Muslims, both prominent and unknown, in support of Christians under attack. These treaties desperately need to be better known among Christians, Muslims, and the general public. For scholars, this book provides much difficult-to-obtain material: facsimiles of primary sources in Arabic and Persian; corrected versions in modern Arabic typescript; and alternate translations. They now have all they need to study the covenants in depth.</p><p><br>"This narrative has the power to unite Muslim and Christian communities.&nbsp;A work of scholarship, its release is timely, and its content critical in fostering mutual respect and religious freedom."--<b>Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf</b>, Chairman, Cordoba Initiative<br> <br>"In his indispensable contribution to the study of the Abrahamic faiths, John Andrew Morrow tells the story of how the Prophet Muhammad used his desert experiences of hospitality and protection to bring Muslims and Christians together. Morrow quotes the Prophet's instruction--as relevant today as in his time: 'With the People of the Book there is to be no strife.'"--<b>Joseph Hobbs</b>, University of Missouri<br> <br>"Today, we realize more than ever that either we will learn to live together like siblings, or we shall perish together like fools.&nbsp;These letters from the Prophet Muhammad to Christian communities can serve to inspire both Muslims and Christians about our ability to live together as God's people, as friends, as neighbors, and as custodians of the same small planet."--<strong>Omid Safi</strong>,&nbsp;University of North Carolina <br> <br><i>The Covenants of the Prophet Muhammad </i>is a useful source for all those interested in the cultural and religious history of the Muslim world and the cultural relationship between Islam and Christianity. It will be very helpful in strengthening tolerance, goodwill, and better understanding between different civilizations; and it opens new horizons for further studies."--<b>Aida Gasimova</b><i>,</i> Baku State University&nbsp;<br> <br>"With painstaking effort and much dedication invested in this groundbreaking work, Professor Morrow will surely manage to attract the attention of Islamic studies students and specialists. Indeed,&nbsp;the book<i>&nbsp;</i>is a genuine call for reconsidering the relationship among the three revealed Abrahamic faiths of Christianity, Judaism and Islam."--<b>Amar Sellam</b>, Mohamed I University&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br>"This book documents what is possibly the third foundational source of Islam: the Prophet's treaties and covenants among people of the Abrahamic faiths. Dr. Morrow brings forth exceptionally important findings that dictate peaceful coexistence among Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and includes multiple translations for comparison of how the Prophet and his followers treated Christians and Jews with respect and care, far beyond a mere tolerance."--<b>Bridget Blomfield</b>, University of Nebraska&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br>"These covenants are not merely historical documents; they remain valid, binding covenants for all Muslims from the moment of their inception until the end of time. Dr. Morrow's work has illuminated a new horizon of Islamic public international law and promotes further scholarly investigation of the covenants." --<b>Hisham M. Ramadan, S.J.D.</b>, Kwantlen Polytechnic University<br><br>"<i>The Covenants of the Prophet Muhammad</i> is a timely, pioneering, and penetrating study that sheds much light on the thoughts and the policy of the Prophet Muhammad."--<b>Mohamed Elkouche</b>, Mohamed I University<b>John Andrew Morrow</b> has served as a faculty member and administrator at numerous colleges and universities, and has authored and edited many books, including the <i>Encyclopedia of Islamic Herbal Medicine </i>(McFarland, 2011), <i>Religion and</i> <i>Revolution: Spiritual and Political Islam in Ernesto Cardenal </i>(Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012), and <i>Islamic Images</i> <i>and Ideas: Essays on Sacred Symbolism </i>(McFarland, 2013).</p><h2>Being and the Meaning of Life (Diamond Heart, Book 3)</h2><p>We live in a world of mystery, wonder, and beauty.

Environmental Studies. Following the traces of the trail blazed by Francis Ponge in <em>Le Carnet du bois de pins</em> (1947), THE PINE-WOODS NOTEBOOK offers a simultaneous study of two environments. It documents the ecologies of two particular stands of conifers (one in the Wasatch front of the Rockies' western edge, the other in the coastal Cascades of the Pacific Northwest); at the same time, it investigates the linguistic environment at the intersection of the words pitch and pine in all of their denotations. An essay built from densely patterned sentences, THE PINE-WOODS NOTEBOOK records the surprising resonance of chance lexical encounters and argues for the inextricable interweaving of the phenomenology of the conifer (its shape, scent, and cool darkness--as well as the distinctive sound of the wind in its branches) together with the vitality of its fluid sap and disseminating reproductive processes. Both the distinctive scent and coolness of a pine grove, for example, turn out (according to recent scientific studies) to be consequences of the same chemical process, in which uniquely structured molecular chains form as the trees 'exhale.' Similarly, the emotive 'sigh' of the wind in the pine--recurrently regarded, across cultures and centuries, as the most beautiful of natural sounds--can be heard as sexual reproduction made audible, since the pine depends on the wind (rather than insects or birds) for pollination. Here, the erotic longing of pining meets the affective reflex of breath as they articulate the branching of the signifier.</p><p>Craig Dworkin is the author of several books of poetry and chapbooks, including <em>Dure</em> (Cuneiform, 2004), STRAND (Roof, 2005), PARSE (Atelos, 2008), <em>The Perverse Library</em> (Information As Material, 2010), MOTES (Roof, 2011), <em>Chapter XXIV</em> (Red Butte Press, 2013), ALKALI (Counterpath Press, 2015), <em>12 Erroneous Displacements and a Fact</em> (Information As Material, 2016), <em>DEF</em> (Information As Material, 2017), and THE PINE-WOODS NOTEBOOK (Kenning Editions, 2019.

In an age when secularism and materialism numb the human spirit, China's amazing Christians demonstrate the power of living faith. In 1950 China's Christians numbered about a million. Today, estimates range between 30 and 70 million! How did this body of believers grow so rapidly under atheism and materialism? Bold as a Lamb is the true story of Pastor Samuel Lamb. Imprisoned for more than twenty years for preaching the Gospel, he became the beloved secret pastor to hundreds of fellow inmates. After his release in 1978, he built a phenomenal "house church" congregation of more than a thousand. Soon, however, he became the special target of those determined to destroy the mushrooming house church movement in China. His church was closed and his ministry tools were confiscated. Yet this man remains undaunted, standing boldly -- and with spiritual grace, against fierce opposition. This is the fascinating, eye-opening account of one of China's best-known pastors, his dauntless congregation, and how they found joy and optimism in the face of relentless persecution.</p></p><p><p>Ken Anderson was a free-lance writer for more than half a century, authoring some forty books, hundreds of magazine articles and short stories. He was also active in the production of motion pictures and videos.</p>Chapter 1 Ah Leng stepped off the bus at Zhong Shan and hesitated. A line of trucks and taxis passed. In Guangzhou, as in all of China's cities, drivers of motor vehicles paid almost no attention to pedestrians. "Da Ma Zhan is a very narrow street," Wu San, his friend in the chemistry laboratory at the university had told him, "not wide enough for automobiles. You will enter through a small gate." Ah Leng saw the gate and ventured cautiously onto the street as another string of taxis approached. A bus appeared, but halted for passengers. Bicyclers rang their caution bells. A taxi changed lanes, looming at him. Ah Leng darted aside, stiff-arming a bicycle to avoid being brushed. The rider, forced off balance, scolded him. Ah Leng reached the gate of which Wu San had spoken and looked through to Da Ma Zhan. The street appeared to be as old as the Manchus. Since his boyhood, Ah Leng had been fond of old and narrow streets. He moved forward beneath protruding poles of laundry rustling in the evening breeze. Families sat at their doorsides, grandfathers looking blankly out onto the way and into the past, mothers sifting rice, and dogs drowsing. A clutter of men, some playing, some observing, surrounded a noisy game of mah-jongg, similar at first glance to dominoes but more complicated. Tiny shops offered clothing, tobacco, and sundries. The blended aroma of pork, fish, steamed rice, and vegetables wafted from hawker stands. Ah Leng moved along, ignoring the sounds and smells, his eyes intent on the house numbers&#x2014;63, 49, ... "Take care not to miss it," Wu San had cautioned. "The entrance is hard to find, so watch closely for the number 35 Da Ma Zhan." Ah Leng slowed his pace, and there it was: residence unit 35. Even if he had missed the small number, Ah Leng would have found the house, because from the floor above street level and the floor above that, he heard the melody of many voices. To suffer is to serve our Lord. Our tears, like His, touch Heaven. We are the children of His Word To whom all grace is given. The lyrics and the music stirred in the student a strange feeling. Confucius had once said, "Poetry arouses, music is our crown." What might the venerated one have said if he had heard the singing of these Christians? How strange for Ah Leng to think such thoughts&#x2014;Ah Leng, a student of the late 1980s&#x2014;a scientist, materialist, and atheist. He moved to the bleak, narrow stairway, hesitating as his eyes adjusted to the darkness. A small dim neon light at the top of the stairway gave scant but sufficient illumination to silhouette nearly a dozen people sitting on the concrete steps. "Church," Ah Leng said to them. "My friend says I go up these stairs to a church." "One does. Welcome," a woman near the bottom responded. "The Lord be with you this beautiful evening of his making." She gestured for him to sit on the step immediately below her feet. Since this was Ah Leng's first time to visit 35 Da Ma Zhan, he did not realize that these people, like himself, had arrived late. "Welcome," the woman repeated. "Sit with us here," a man near the top called out. "Seats above are already full." "But young people can always make room for one more," the woman said pleasantly. She pressed her feet tightly against the hallway wall and motioned for Ah Leng to proceed upward. He squeezed by the others in the passageway and slowly moved up the stairs. When the singing stopped, Ah Leng heard a man's voice coming from the overhead speakers. It was a strong voice, authoritative but kind. "We welcome you in the name of our Lord Jesus. If you are with us for the first time, we give you double welcome! You will find our only purpose is to declare the Gospel and to learn together how to live the Christian life." Pressing tightly against the stairway wall, Ah Leng reached the top and came into a narrow corridor packed tightly with more people&#x2014;some on a narrow bench, most on stools the size of bicycle seats. An elegant woman dressed in peasant trousers and a plain mandarin jacket looked up at him and smiled. For a moment he wondered if he had seen her among the faculty at a campus convocation. Next to her a man, most likely her husband, studied some mimeographed notes so intently that he didn't notice Ah Leng. A college-aged girl stepped out from an adjoining doorway. Her appearance drew Ah Leng's attention to her and to a small room where over a hundred people crowded into a space meant for fifty people. The girl was attractive, with curious, wise eyes. She wore student clothing and had a braided pigtail hanging to the middle of her back. She smiled warmly as if they had met before, although they had not. "You visit us for the first time," she whispered, not as a question but as a greeting. "We have closed-circuit video at this lower level, as you can see, but perhaps you wish to go upstairs. Many students have come again tonight." She smiled, her eyes twinkling. "They always seem able to squeeze in one more." Ah Leng watched the video screen where the man spoke. "For our next song of praise to the Lord, turn to number 63 in the Spiritual Voice hymnal." "This way," the girl motioned, having inched her own way to the foot of a second stairway. Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus our blessed Redeemer! The people around Ah Leng began to sing, maintaining close tempo with those on the floor above. The experience was new to him, although it did not surprise him. He had heard that Christianity was a religion whose teachings were conveyed in various ways.</p><h2>World Christianity: A Historical and Theological Introduction</h2><p><p>Christianity is vibrant and growing in the non-western &#x201c;majority&#x201d; world and Christianity is changing as a result. Pachuau surveys the current trending approaches to recognizing and investigating &#x201c;world Christianity&#x201d; and explores the salient features of the demographic changes that mark a measurable shift in the center of gravity from the northwest part of the globe to the southern continents. This shift is not just geographical. World Christianity is ultimately about the changing and diversifying character of Christianity and a renewed recognition of the dynamic universality of Christian faith itself: Christianity is a shared religion in that people of different cultures and societies make it their own while being transformed by it. Christanity is translatable and adaptable to all cultures while challenging each with its transformative power. Pachuau also charts the theological reestablishment of the missionary enterprise founded on understandings of God&#x2019;s mission in the world (mission Dei), a mission of cross-cultural gospel diffusion for missionary advocates in the majority world but one of near neighbor missional engagement for the contagious Charismatic Christianity of the majority world. <br> <br> This book is both a descriptive study and a thoughtful analysis of world Christianity&#x2019;s demographics, life, representation, and thought. The book an also gives an account of the historical emergence of World Christianity and its theological characteristics using a methodology that stresses&nbsp; the productive tension between the universal and particular in understanding a fundamentally adaptable Christian faith.</p> <p>"Lalsangkima Pachuau offers us a brilliant overview of the promise of historically and theologically researching and exploring Christianity as a global religion." - Jayakiran Sebastian, United Lutheran Seminary, Gettysburg, PA.</p> <br></p><p>Lalsangkima Pachuau is the John Wesley Beeson Professor of Christian Mission and Dean of Advanced Research Programs at Asbury Seminary.

In this book, Alain Danielou traces the development of musical scales and tuning from their origins in both China and India, through their merging in ancient Greece, and on to the development of the Western traditions of modal and polyphonic music. Understanding these potent harmonic relationships offers a way for today&#39;s musicians to transcend the limitations of overly rationalistic music by drawing on its metaphysical roots.</p><p>Alain Dani�lou (1907-1994) was without question a Renaissance man. Following his early years as an artist, dancer, and musician in Paris (Cocteau, Diaghilev, and Stravinsky were among his friends), Dani�lou settled in India, where he spent fifteen years in the study of Sanskrit, philosophy, and music. After numerous university appointments in India, he returned in 1963 to Europe, establishing the Institute of Comparative Music Studies in Berlin for the reevaluation of Asian music. Dani�lou wrote more than thirty books about the philosophy, religion, history, and arts of India, including <i>Gods of Love and Ecstasy</i>; <i>Myths and Gods of India</i>; <i>Virtue, Success, Pleasure, and Liberation</i>; <i>While the Gods Play</i>; <i>The Phallus</i>; and <i>The Complete Kama Sutra</i>.MUSIC <br> <br>Music, above all other arts, has always been esteemed for its power to speak directly to our higher consciousness. Based on unchanging laws of number and proportion, music also embodies the fundamental metaphysical principles underlying everyday reality. How do these two aspects of music&#x2019;s power, it&#x2019;s twin roots in consciousness and mathematics, relate to one another? And why does each of the world&#x2019;s music systems seem to have its own unique effects on consciousness? <br> <br><em>Music and the Power of Sound</em> is a new and thoroughly revised edition of Alain Dani�lou&#x2019;s pioneering <em>Introduction to the Study of Musical Scales</em>, an important book that for many years has been virtually unobtainable in the West. In these pages, Dani�lou traces the development of musical scales from their origins in both China and India, through the merging in ancient Greece of those two systems, and on to the development of the Western musical traditions of modal and polyphonic music. <br> <br>Because musical pitches have specific frequencies, their relationships can be expressed numerically as ratios of greater or lesser complexity: the simpler the ratio, the more euphonious the harmony. The musicians of antiquity understood scales to be either cycles of simple intervals (China), arrays of varying intervals around a central pitch (India), or a combination of the two (Greece). Any one of these methods of construction resulted in a multitude of contrasting scales, each capable of expressing distinct emotional and spiritual states. Those scales, Dani�lou argues, not only reflected but also influenced the spiritual values of their parent civilizations. <br> <br>In the purity of simple harmonic ratios can be found the secrets of music&#x2019;s affective power. These potent harmonic relationships offer a way for today&#x2019;s musicians to transcend the limitations of our overly rationalistic musical system and fashion a synthesis with the metaphysical roots of the most eternal of arts. <br> <br>ALAIN DANI�LOU (1907-1994), the founder of the International Institute of Comparative Musicology in Berlin, elucidated for tens of thousands of readers the meanings of the arts and religious traditions of both East and West. He was an accomplished player of the v&#x129;n� and taught in the music department at the University of Benares. His numerous books, the product of a career spanning six decades, include: <em>The Myths and Gods of India</em>; <em>Gods of Love and Ecstasy</em>; <em>While the Gods Play</em>; <em>Virtue, Success, Pleasure, and Liberation</em>; <em>The Phallus</em>; <em>Yoga: Mastering the Secrets of Matter and the Universe</em>; and <em>The Complete K�ma S&#x1eef;tra</em>. <br></p><h2>Humanizing the Education Machine: How to Create Schools That Turn Disengaged Kids Into Inspired Learners</h2><p><b>A clear roadmap for the new territory of education</b> <p>Education in the U.S. has been under fire for quite some time, and for good reason. The numbers alone tell a very disconcerting story: according to various polls, 70% of teachers are disengaged. Add to that the fact that the United States ranks last among industrialized nations for college graduation levels, and it's evident there's a huge problem that needs to be addressed. Yet the current education system and its school buildings&#x2014;with teachers standing in front of classrooms and lecturing to students&#x2014;have gone largely unchanged since the 19th century. </p><p><i>Humanizing the Education Machine</i> tackles this tough issue head-on. It describes how the education system has become ineffective by not adapting to fit students' needs, learning styles, perspectives, and lives at home. This book explains how schools can evolve to engage students and involve parents. It serves to spread hope for reform and equip parents, educators, administrators, and communities to: </p><ul> <li>Analyze the pitfalls of the current U.S. education system</li> <li>Intelligently argue the need to reform the current landscape of education</li> <li>Work to make a difference in the public education system</li> <li>Be an informed advocate for your child or local school system</li> </ul> <p>If you're a concerned parent or professional looking for a trusted resource on the need for education reform, look no further than <i>Humanizing the Education Machine</i>.

But despite those billions and the best efforts of so many, every measurement continues to verify a decline of crisis magnitude. </p><p>However, <i>Humanizing the Education Machine</i> is not a rant or a funeral dirge. Instead, it reveals the fresh breezes from dynamic and <i>thriving</i> outlier schools all across the country. From those inspiring models, authors Rex Miller, Bill Latham, and Brian Cahill offer a vision and a blueprint for a growing child-led revolution in learning. </p><p>Armed with solid research, captivating stories, and a clear road map to the future, they reveal an exciting journey into a whole new pathway&#x2014;and profoundly human approach&#x2014;to learning. This book is designed for parents, teachers, students, administrators, and community leaders who want to transform their traditional schools into vibrant and resilient future-ready communities of learning. </p><p>The method of research behind <i>Humanizing the Education Machine</i> is unique; more than 60 teachers, community leaders, professionals, and kids engaged in research across the country over two years. This group&#x2014;the K&#x2013;12 MindShift&#x2014;discovered the best practices of student engagement and future-ready learning found throughout America, from at-risk communities to progressive and prosperous communities. </p><p><i>Humanizing the Education Machine</i> tells a great story of what twenty-first century learning looks like and how to bring that dynamic into your school or district. And the authors tell that very human story with passion, humor, and humility. The reader will see how the Gutenberg Revolution, which created a transforming model for learning, is now superseded by an equally transforming Google revolution. This is a manifesto for those ready to take action and a manual for leading your school or district from Gutenberg to Google. The journey will restore what makes learning uniquely human and relevant for an era of unpredictable and cataclysmic change.</p></p><h2>A Death in Tuscany: Michele Ferrara: Book 2</h2><p><p>In the picturesque Tuscan hill town of Scandicci, the body of a girl is discovered.

Orr's archetypal subject in the new poems and selections from six previous collections (including City of Salt and We Must Make a Kingdom of It) is fratricide. As a child, Orr accidentally shot and killed his young brother in a hunting accident. In "Gathering the Bones Together," his speaker describes the experience in a trademark clenched, almost self-flagellatingly declarative style: "I was twelve when I killed him; I felt my own bones wrench from my body." "A Litany" returns to the subject: "I remember him falling beside me, the dark stain already seeping across his parka hood I remember screaming and running the half mile to our house." And the experience is echoed by the poet's agonized critique, "To My Father, Dying": "Where is your scorn now? Where your jaggedness, old antagonist?... Your handsome face gone slack..." For Orr, even a young daughter's bloodying herself seems fair game for a poem, as when, "against admonishment, my daughter balanced on the couch back, fell and cut her mouth." There are some attempts at relieving the gloom, as in "Best" "To live and love is best" or "A Shelf Is a Ledge," where a volume of Darwin "screams in the dark: Survive! Survive!" Still, the threnody of titles here, like "Song of the Invisible Corpse in the Field" and "Song: Early Death of the Mother," makes for a consistently mournful stance that, perhaps purposefully, does not advance linguistically or emotionally. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Delighting in the Law of the Lord: God&#39;s Alternative to Legalism and Moralism</h2><p><p><strong>God&#x2019;s <em>people</em> have neglected God&#x2019;s <em>law</em>.</strong></p><p>We are steeped in a culture in which people hate being told how to live and idolize uninhibited &#x201c;freedom.&#x201d; What&#x2019;s more, many Christians seem to think the law <em>only</em> leads to legalism and therefore doesn&#x2019;t have a role to play in the Christian life.

Both matches were tremendously exciting and hard fought and both produced chess of an extremely high level.</p><p> </p><p>The 1986 clash was groundbreaking in that it was the first World Championship match between two Soviets to take place outside Moscow. It was split between London and Leningrad with twelve games being played at both venues. The defending champion was now Kasparov (having won the 1985 match) and he leapt into an apparently decisive three point lead.

Kasparov approached the final game with a one point deficit, knowing that only a win would enable him to retain the title. When the game was adjourned overnight in a position where Kasparov had to win to stay champion, Spanish TV cleared its entire schedule so that the nail-biting conclusion could be watched live.

Me. Gin Blanco. The assassin known as the Spider. I killed people, something that I was very, very good at.<br> <br>Tonight I had my sights set on my most dangerous target ever&#x2014;Mab Monroe, the Fire elemental who&#x2019;d murdered my family when I was thirteen.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d been plotting the hit for weeks. Where to do it, how to get past security, what weapon to use, how to get away after the fact. Now, on this cold, cold night, I&#x2019;d finally decided to carry out my deadly plan.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d been on the prowl for hours. Three hours, to be exact. Each one spent out in the bitter February frost, including climbing my way up the side of a fifteen-story mansion one icy foot at a time. Hard bits of snow pelted my body as I tried to keep the shrieking wind from tearing me off the side of the building. It wasn&#x2019;t the most comfortable that I&#x2019;d ever been during one of my hits, but it was necessary.<br> <br>Too bad Mab knew that I was coming for her.<br> <br>Oh, I hadn&#x2019;t expected it to be easy, but slipping past the massive net of security, first in the snowy woods around Mab&#x2019;s mansion, and then closer to the house itself, was a bit more problematic than I&#x2019;d expected. The whole area was teeming with the giants that the Fire elemental employed as her personal bodyguards, not to mention nasty land mines and other traps strung through the trees like invisible spiderwebs. Of course, I could have dropped the giants, killing them one by one as I went along, but that would have resulted in the alarm being raised, and the security net tightening that much more.<br> <br>So instead I&#x2019;d opted for a silent, nonlethal approach&#x2014;at least for now. It had taken me an hour to work my way through the woods, then another one to get close enough to the mansion to slither up the stairs to a second-floor balcony and then heave myself up onto part of the roof that sloped down there. After that, things had gotten easier, since there were no sensors, alarms, or giants posted on the roofs that covered the various parts of the massive structure. Not many people bothered with such things above the second floor, since most folks weren&#x2019;t brave or crazy enough to climb any higher, especially on a snowy night like this one.<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t particularly brave or crazy, but I was determined to kill Mab.<br> <br>A strong gust of wind slapped and then backhanded the mansion, screaming in my ears and hurling more frozen snow off the eaves and onto me. The chunks punched my body before disappearing over the side of the roof and dropping down into the eerie silver dark of the night.<br> <br>I grunted at the hard, stinging impacts. As an elemental, I could have used my Stone magic to protect myself, could have tapped into my power and made my skin hard as marble so that the rocklike wads of snow would bounce off my body like bullets off Superman&#x2019;s chest. But elementals can sense when others of their ilk are using their powers, and I didn&#x2019;t want to give Mab any hint that I was here.<br> <br>At least, not before I&#x2019;d killed her.<br> <br>By this point, I&#x2019;d worked my way up to the sixth floor, where the mansion&#x2019;s blueprints had indicated there was a particularly large dining room. According to some chatter that my foster brother, Finnegan Lane, had picked up from his various spies, Mab was hosting a fancy dinner party this evening. Finn hadn&#x2019;t been able to determine what the party was for or even who had been invited, but that didn&#x2019;t much matter. Mab was getting dead tonight&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t care who was in the room with her.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d been in position for more than an hour now, outside the dining room window, lying flat on a part of the roof that plateaued before sloping down at a severe angle and dropping away to the ground far below. The blowing snow and murky shadows, combined with the glare of the lights inside, made me all but invisible to anyone looking out through the window.<br> <br>But really, the worst part of the night wasn&#x2019;t the guards, the cold, the snow, or even the icy, treacherous climb&#x2014;it was having to listen to the stones around me.<br> <br>People&#x2019;s emotions, actions, and feelings sink into their environment over time, especially into the stone around them. As a Stone elemental, I could hear those emotional vibrations in whatever form the element took around me, from loose pebbles underfoot to the brick of a building to a marble sculpture. The sounds, the murmurs, the whispers that reverberated through the stones let me know what had happened in a particular spot, what sorts of people had been there, and all the dark, ugly, twisted things that they&#x2019;d done in the meantime&#x2014;or who might be lurking around in the here and now, trying to get the drop on me.<br> <br>Fire, heat, pain, death. That&#x2019;s what the stones of Mab&#x2019;s mansion murmured of, punctuated by sly, smirking, confident whispers of power and money&#x2014;both things that the Fire elemental had in abundance. But the most disturbing thing, the sound that made me grind my teeth, was the cackling of maniacal madness that rippled through the gray stones. Wave after wave of it, as though the rock had somehow been tortured until it was just as broken, burned, and dead as Mab&#x2019;s many victims.<br> <br>After a minute of listening to the stones&#x2019; insane, wailing cries, I&#x2019;d blocked out the damned disturbing noise and had gotten on with more important matters, like checking my weapons. As always, I carried five silverstone knives&#x2014;one up either sleeve, one against the small of my back, and two more tucked into my boots. The knives were my weapons of choice on most jobs because they were sharp, strong, and almost unbreakable. Just like me.<br> <br>But Mab was a Fire elemental, which meant that she could create, control, and manipulate fire the same way that I could stone. And Mab wasn&#x2019;t just any mere Fire elemental&#x2014;she was rumored to have more raw magic, more raw power, than any elemental born in the last five hundred years. She could easily fry me alive with her magic before I got close enough to even think about plunging my silverstone knives into her burning black heart.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d decided to play it smart and keep a healthy distance between us, just in case things didn&#x2019;t work out exactly as I&#x2019;d planned tonight. So I&#x2019;d brought another weapon along with me&#x2014;a crossbow. It looked like your typical crossbow&#x2014;heavy, substantial, deadly&#x2014;made even more so by the rifle scope that I&#x2019;d mounted above the trigger and the six-inch-long, barbed bolt already in firing position. Since it was made out of silverstone, a particularly tough magical metal, the bolt would rip through anything it came into contact with&#x2014;glass, stone, flesh, bones.<br> <br>The crossbow currently sat on the window ledge, with the barb pointing inside. I&#x2019;d been in firing position for more than fifteen minutes, and all I had to do to release the deadly bolt was pull the trigger.<br> <br>Good thing, as people were starting to arrive for dinner.<br> <br>The black velvet drapes had been drawn to either side of the window, letting me see into the dining room. Closing the drapes was something else most folks didn&#x2019;t bother with above the second floor. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy of Mab&#x2019;s bodyguards not to see to a pesky little detail like that.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d actually been inside Mab&#x2019;s mansion once before, when I&#x2019;d been stalking another target a few months ago, and the dining room before me was just as opulent as I remembered the rest of the house being. The room was a hundred feet wide, with a ceiling that soared high above it. Gold and silver leaf glinted in elaborate patterns on the ceiling, while several chandeliers dropped down from it and glistened like jewel-colored dewdrops above a polished ebony table. Four dozen place settings of fine china covered the table, along with matching flatware. Silver buckets filled with ice, champagne, and other expensive liquors were spaced down both sides of the table, so that everyone could have easy access to the booze.<br> <br>For the last ten minutes, tuxedo-clad giants moved through the area, bringing in plates, napkins, liquor, and everything else that might be needed. My gaze drifted over to a buffet table that had been set up on the far side of the room. Mab and her guests were dining on lobster tonight, among other delicacies.<br> <br>Finally, one of the giants opened the double doors at the end of the room, bowed his head, and held out his arm, ushering the guests inside. Time to get the party started, in more ways than one.<br> <br>Most of the guests drifted in one by one, although a few were coupled up in groups of two or more. Men and women. Old, young, fat, thin, black, white, Hispanic, dwarves, giants, vampires. There was more variety to the crowd than I&#x2019;d expected. Usually, all of Mab&#x2019;s business associates looked the same&#x2014;middle-aged men with more money than common sense and all the greedy, twisted appetites to match.<br> <br>But these people were different. Oh, they all looked like I&#x2019;d thought they would&#x2014;dressed to the nines in tuxedos and evening gowns, with expensive jewels, perfect makeup, and coiffed hair to match. But they didn&#x2019;t act like I&#x2019;d thought they would. They didn&#x2019;t mingle, they didn&#x2019;t start drinking and eating, and perhaps most telling, they didn&#x2019;t even bother talking to each other. Instead, all the singles, couples, and tight-knit groups stayed to themselves, leaving several feet of distance in between each of them. Curious. Most curious indeed.<br> <br>Through the rifle scope, my eye went from one face to another, trying to get a sense of exactly who Mab had invited to her shindig and why they were acting so strangely. I might not care what their names were or how much money they had, but I did want to know if any of them fancied themselves tough guys who might be a threat to me. Not that I was planning on sticking around after I took out Mab, but it never hurt to be prepared. Fletcher Lane, the old man who had been my mentor, had taught me that, among many other deadly things.<br> <br>Despite their tuxedos, gowns, and glittering jewels, every single one of the men and women had a tense, coiled, predatory air about them, and they all gave each other the same flat, hard stare, as if they were all competing for the same prize and would do anything to get it. A few of them actually eyed the silverware, as if they were thinking about picking up the knives, spoons, and forks, and thinning out the crowd a bit before the show got started.<br> <br>I frowned. Mab did business with all sorts of unsavory characters, but something about the people inside the dining room bothered me. Maybe because they all reminded me... of me. Gin Blanco. The Spider.<br> <br>Before I had time to think that thought through, the double doors opened again, and Mab Monroe stepped into the room.<br> <br>The Fire elemental strolled through the tense crowd until she reached the middle of the dining room. Everyone turned to stare at her, and what little conversation there had been stopped, like a radio that had been turned off midsong. Like her guests, Mab had dressed up for the evening, in a long, sea-green gown that complemented her pale skin. Her coppery red hair was piled on top of her head, each artfully arranged strand dripping down the sides of her face like so much blood. But the most striking thing about Mab was her eyes&#x2014;two bottomless black pools that seemed to suck up all the available light in the room instead of reflecting it back. Even the bright chandeliers overhead appeared to dim as she passed underneath them.<br> <br>The severe V in the front of Mab&#x2019;s gown showed off her creamy d�colletage, as well as the necklace she wore. A flat gold circle encased the Fire elemental&#x2019;s neck, accentuated by a ruby set into the middle of the design. Several dozen wavy golden rays surrounded the gem, and the intricate diamond cutting on the metal caught the light and reflected it back, making it look like the rays were flickering.<br> <br>The flamboyant ruby-and-gold design was much more than just a mere necklace&#x2014;it was a rune. A sunburst. The symbol for fire. Mab&#x2019;s personal rune, used by her alone. Runes were how elementals and other magic types in Ashland identified themselves, their families, their power, their alliances, and even their businesses to others.<br> <br>I had a rune too. A small circle surrounded by eight thin rays. A spider rune. The symbol for patience and my assassin name. Actually, I had two runes&#x2014;one branded into either palm. The marks had been put there by Mab the night she&#x2019;d murdered my family. That&#x2019;s when the Fire elemental had tortured me by duct-taping a silverstone medallion shaped like the spider rune in between my hands and then superheating the metal with her magic until it had melted into my flesh, marking me forever.<br> <br>The sight of Mab and her flashing sunburst necklace made the spider rune scars on my palms itch and burn, the way they always did whenever I was around the Fire elemental, but I didn&#x2019;t move from my position. Didn&#x2019;t rub my hands together to make the uncomfortable sensation go away. Didn&#x2019;t let out a tense sigh. Hell, I didn&#x2019;t even blink.<br> <br>Killing Mab was much more important than the memories that filled my mind or the pain that they brought me, even now, seventeen years after the fact. Now was not the time to be sentimental or sloppy. Not when I had a chance to kill the bitch, to finally end our family feud once and for all.<br> <br>Inside the dining room, Mab turned in a circle, her black eyes roaming over her guests, sizing them up just like I had.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to see that you all could make it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Fire elemental&#x2019;s voice was low, soft, and silky, with just a hint of a rasp to it. Still, despite her gentle tone, a clear undercurrent of power and authority crackled in Mab&#x2019;s words.<br> <br>Thanks to Finn and his ability to get his hands on absolutely anything, I&#x2019;d opened the dining room window earlier and fastened a small bug inside underneath the windowsill. The bug&#x2019;s receiver, which I&#x2019;d stuck in my ear several minutes ago, let me hear Mab loud and clear.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t sure exactly how many of you would show up on such short notice,&#x201d; Mab continued. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m most pleased by the turnout.&#x201d;<br> <br>I frowned. Turnout? What was the Fire elemental up to, and who were these mysterious people that she&#x2019;d invited to her mansion? I had a funny feeling they weren&#x2019;t the tame businessmen and businesswomen that I&#x2019;d expected to find.<br> <br>A woman stepped forward, separating herself from the pack. She wore an evening gown like all the others, but the garment was just a bit too big for her thin, wiry body. The fabric was slick and cheap, and the mint green color was faded, as though she&#x2019;d been wearing the dress for years, pulling it out of the depths of her closet for special occasions just like this one. She had to be seventy if she was a day, and her skin had the dark, nut brown look of someone who&#x2019;d spent her entire life outdoors, working under the burning sun. Her gray hair had been pulled back into a tight bun, which set off her sharp, angular face, and her eyes were a pale, washed-out blue.<br> <br>The woman was one of those who&#x2019;d come in with someone else. A young girl of about sixteen stood off to her right, dressed in a low-rent pink gown with a poofy ballerina skirt, which made it look like a prom dress. The girl was as light as the woman was dark, with long, molasses-colored hair shot through with honey-blond highlights. Her hazel eyes were wide and innocent in her lean, almost gaunt face, and the girl k...</p><h2>Shanghai Homes: Palimpsests of Private Life (Global Chinese Culture)</h2><p>In the dazzling global metropolis of Shanghai, what has it meant to call this city home?

She lives in Atlanta.Chapter One<br><br>Aid makes itself out to be a practical enterprise, but in Africa at least it's romantics who do most of the work-incongruously, because Africa outside of books and movies is hard and unromantic. In Africa the metaphor is always the belly. "He is eating from that," Africans will say, and what they mean is that is how he gets his living. African politics, says the French scholar Jean-François Bayart, is "the politics of the belly." The power of the proverbial African big man depends on his ability to feed his followers; his girth advertises the wealth he has to share. In Africa the first obligation of kinship is to share food; and yet, as the Nuer say, "eating is warring." They tell this story: Once upon a time Stomach lived by itself in the bush, eating small insects roasted in brush fire, for Man was created apart from Stomach. Then one day Man was walking in the bush and came across Stomach. Man put Stomach in its present place that it might feed there. When it lived by itself, Stomach was satisfied with small morsels of food, but now that Stomach is part of man, it craves more no matter how much it eats. That is why Stomach is the enemy of Man.<br><br>In Europe and North America, we have to look in the mirror to see Stomach. "Get in touch with your hunger," American diet counselors urge their clients. Hunger is an option. Like so much else in the West, it has become a question of vanity. That is why some in the West ask: Is it Stomach or Mirror that is the enemy of Man? And Africa-Africa is a mirror in which the West sees its big belly. The story of Western aid to Sudan is the story of the intersection of the politics of the belly and the politics of the mirror.<br><br>It's a story that began in the nineteenth century much as it seems to be ending in the twenty-first, with a handful of humanitarians driven by urges often half hidden even from themselves. The post-Enlightenment triumph of reason and science gave impetus to the Western conviction that it is our duty to show the planet's less fortunate how to live. But even in the heyday of colonialism, when Western idealists had a lot more firepower at their disposal, Africa's most memorable empire-builders tended to be those romantics and eccentrics whose openness to the irrational-to the emotions, to mysticism, to ecstasy-made them misfits in their own societies. And the colonials were riding the crest of a wave of Victorian enthusiasm to remake Africa in our own image. If the rhetoric of today's aid workers is equally grand, they in fact are engaged in a far less ambitious enterprise. With little money and no force backing them up, they are a kind of imperial rearguard, foot soldiers covering the retreat of a West worn down by the continent's stubborn and opaque vitality. They may be animated by many of the old impulses, idealistic and otherwise, but they have less confidence in their ability to see them through. It takes more than an ideal, even an unselfish belief in an ideal, to keep today's aid workers in place. Emma had some ideals, but it was romance that lured her to Africa.<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br> She was born in India, where her parents, Maggie and Julian McCune, had met and married in 1962, and the direction of her life, like theirs, was pounded and shaped by the ebbing tide of the British Empire. Maggie, a trim and crisp former secretary, still calls herself an ex-colonial, though the sun was already setting on colonialism when she was born in 1942 in Assam. She published a memoir in 1999 called Til the Sun Grows Cold about her relationship with Emma. The child of a loveless marriage between a British tea planter and an Australian showgirl who met on board a wartime ship, Maggie spent a lonely colonial childhood as a paying guest at various English homes and boarding schools. Emma's father, Julian-or "Bunny," as Maggie called him-was an Anglo-Irish engineer who had knocked around Britain's colonies for at least a decade before he and Maggie settled down in Assam.<br><br>Theirs was an unfortunate match from the start. Maggie, shy and wounded, was only twenty-one when she was introduced to Julian on a visit to her father in India. She married him, she admits in her book, mainly to escape England and the hard-drinking mother whose theatrics she despised. With depths of neediness her husband never seems to have fathomed, she wanted nothing more than to bring up lots of children in the safe and conventional family she felt she had been denied as a child. Julian, fourteen years older, was a charming sportsman who thrived on admiration. He also liked his whiskey. He seems to have been unprepared to bear any responsibilities beyond excelling at shirkar, the hunting and fishing beloved of British colonial administrators in India. Perhaps their marriage might have survived if they had been able to stay in India, where Julian, simply by virtue of being an Englishman who had attended some well-known public schools, was able to provide the luxurious lifestyle they had both come to expect.<br><br>In Maggie's words, life was "heavenly" for the British hired in those days by London tea companies to run the Assam tea estates. The British lived in comfortable bungalows, the adults attended by Indian servants and the children watched by Indian nursemaids. The men began work at six o'clock in the morning, but after two hours they broke for breakfast. At noon it was time for lunch, and after lunch everybody took two "golden and silent" hours of siesta. After siesta, Maggie writes, "there was a little more work to do, leaving time for tennis, a round of golf or a chukka or two of polo before the sun sank. Then the sun-downer drinks parties began, followed by dinner and dancing" at the club. But by the time Emma was born in 1964 and her sister Erica in 1965, it had become plain that the postwar world was going to have a lot less room for people like the McCunes.<br><br>For India, as for so many other colonies, the end of the Raj in 1948 was only the beginning of the slow and subtle process of loosening Britain's control over the country. In the first few years under the new Indian government, the British tea companies operated pretty much as they had under British administration. But by the late 1960s, they were under pressure from the government to replace British employees with Indians. Julian lost his job supervising the maintenance of the equipment used to grade and prepare tea leaves. Maggie's father was pensioned off and decided to return to England. In her book, Maggie says that she and Julian enjoyed mixing with people of all races in Assam, but the only Indians she mentions socializing with were the petty royals for whom the dissolution of empire was almost as much of a disaster as it was for the British. Julian talked about emigrating to Rhodesia or South Africa, where many of their British friends from India had already gone, but Maggie worried about moving to another refuge that might prove temporary. She wanted to spare her children the uncomfortable colonial sense she had always had of never quite fitting in England. She wanted "Home" to really feel like home for them. In 1966 the McCunes decided to move to Yorkshire, where Julian had gone to school and had family. Emma was two.<br><br>There was an old manor house on the windswept edge of the Vale of York that Bunny McCune had never forgotten in all his years of wandering. Julian's parents were dead, but his mother had come from Leeds, and as a boy he had attended the Aysgarth School in North Yorkshire before going on to Winchester College. Cowling Hall, a long, thin brick-and-plaster Queen Anne mansion not far from Aysgarth on top of a hill overlooking a spectacular view of the Yorkshire Dales, had first captivated his imagination when he was a schoolboy. The house was shaped like an L, and the oldest part had been built from the ruins of a despoiled abbey. It was empty when the McCunes arrived. Local people said it was haunted. A child had died in the house, and a man had suffered a nervous breakdown. It was an imposing, if dilapidated, piece of architecture, but in the winter a bone-chilling wind whistled right through it. The house was so cold that Maggie tells in her book of warming butter for toast by the coal fire in the drawing room. But with six bedrooms, it was more than big enough for what would become a family of six-Jennie was born in 1967 and Johnny in 1970-and Julian had to have it. He had already invested his inheritance in a franchise he planned to set up in North Yorkshire for a firm marketing closed-circuit-television monitoring systems. Charmed by Julian's manners, the titled owners of Cowling Hall agreed to rent it to the McCunes for the nominal sum of six pounds a week.<br><br>A number of Aysgarth old boys still lived into the area, and these former classmates helped the McCunes settle into North Yorkshire's county set. Wensleydale is the heart of James Herriot country, a misty green landscape of ancient stone villages and black-and-white cows that occupies a large place in the sentimental imagination of England. Bunny hunted and fished in the area's magnificent forests and streams; Maggie organized cricket teas and was elected to the local cancer research committee. There were ponies for the children: Maggie saw a moral purpose in such outdoor pursuits. "Ponies are such good discipline," she told me once. "When you come back from riding, you can't just think about yourself. You have to brush down the horse." And there were the all-important public schools. After attending the local primary, Emma became a weekly boarder at Polam Hall in Darlington. Emma is positively radiant in photographs from these years, her cheeks freckled and ruddy as she poses in front of Cowling Hall or astride her pony, Misty.<br><br>Julian and Maggie were a popular couple. If Julian had one talent-and by all accounts, it was an unusual talent in a place as rigid and class-bound as North Yorkshire in the 1960s-it was for striking up friendships with people of wildly different backgrounds. "Julian was a thorough gentleman," Peter Gilbertson, an old schoolmate from Aysgarth, reminisced many years later. "He could go into any worker's cottage or any stately home with his boots on and his spaniels at his heels, and he'd be fine. He'd put two bottles on the table and say, 'Right! We're having a party.' " Among their close friends, the McCunes counted Bedale's local squire and his wife, the doctor, and the vicar. Maggie, who had been raised Catholic, converted to the Church of England. Julian, whose political views Gilbertson describes as "conservative-very conservative," became the treasurer of the local Conservative Association. The genteel McCune facade was impeccable, and Emma's father seems to have felt that this really ought to have been enough. Like so many upper-middle-class public schoolboys of the period, he had been educated to serve the empire. He really had no other skills. After nearly twenty years abroad, he was at first baffled, then angry, to learn that in the Britain to which he had returned, his social graces and his old school tie would not by themselves translate into a sizable income. As Maggie later wrote, his indifference to work, easy to overlook in India, was harder to ignore in Britain. When his security franchise failed to prosper, he went to work for a cousin selling farm equipment to large landowners. After a year or so, the cousin fired him. Julian never discussed business matters with Maggie, and he did not tell her when he lost his job. Nor did he look for a position he considered beneath him. Instead, he pretended he was going off to work each day. After saying good-bye to her and the children, he would drive to a nearby river, park his car, and sit in it reading newspapers. Maggie never guessed that he was unemployed until his cousin finally phoned her to say he had fired Julian more than a year earlier for being "bone-idle, a scrounger, and a liar."<br><br>When Maggie confronted him, Julian acted as if he were above worrying about money, the opinions of others, or even the law. He was arrested for drunken driving. He took up with a woman who lived in the local village. He was taken to court in Leeds for debt. He continued to come home with expensive presents that Maggie had no idea how he bought. Then he was charged with using his position as a treasurer of the local Conservative Association to steal Tory funds. When a judge asked Maggie why her husband had not appeared with her in court the day the two of them were summoned for failing to pay the rent at Cowling Hall, she had to tell him that Julian was too busy fishing for salmon on the river Tweed. In 1975 local bailiffs evicted the McCune family from Cowling Hall. Maggie and the children went to live in a cottage on the grounds of the Aysgarth School; Julian retreated to a crofter's hut high in the Dales, where he found occasional work as a farm laborer. Emma was ten when the family broke up. "Her childhood ended there," her mother writes.<br><br>The very night Maggie discovered that her husband was having an affair with another woman, she happened to be reading one of Emma's favorite childhood stories, Hans Christian Andersen's "Thumbelina." The tale of a tiny girl rescued by a swallow from having to marry a mole, then flown to the warm lands of the south, where she became a princess, must have recalled to the McCunes the magical days in Assam, before they were exiled back "Home." As their troubles mounted in England, perhaps it was only natural that the family should recall their years in India as a time and place in which they had been free to be the aristocrats that Julian, at least, felt himself to be. After a few drinks, Julian was wont to regale the local pubs about how, in India, he had been able to take the law into his own hands and do as he pleased. He loved to tell the story of how he had gotten himself out of jail after accidentally hitting a sacred cow with his car in Calcutta. He never could get used to how the roguish behavior that his fellow expatriates had found so entertaining in India met with disapproval in England. When he invited the Yorkshire policemen who had caught him driving drunk to join him for a brandy before their court appearance, an English judge was not amused.</p><h2>The Camping Trip (The Adventures of Pettson and Findus)</h2><p>Pettson and Findus are back in this hilarious tale about camping.<br><br>When Findus finds a tent in the attic, Pettson starts imagining what it would be like to go hiking by the lake and to cook on the grill as the sun is setting. But when the hens want to join in the fun too . . . things turn out very differently than what Pettson had in mind.</p><p>Sven Nordqvist was born in Helsingborg, Sweden. Although he studied architecture, he always wanted to be an illustrator and found work illustrating advertisements, posters, and textbooks. In 1983 he won first prize in a children&#x2019;s book competition and since then has worked as an author and illustrator of children&#x2019;s books. He is a renowned children&#x2019;s book illustrator and writer in Sweden and across Europe. When he&#x2019;s not illustrating books for children, he spends time building playgrounds, children&#x2019;s play areas at hospitals, and decorations for schools. Carpentry has always been an important part of Nordqvist&#x2019;s life&#x2014;often reflected in the actions of his industrious character Pettson&#x2014;with the central goal being the enrichment of children&#x2019;s lives. The beloved Pettson and Findus stories draw, in part, on Nordqvist&#x2019;s loving observations of his two sons when they were younger. His unique illustrations are inspired by the delights of everyday life.PreS-Gr 3&#x2014;A new addition to the internationally beloved series that features a toddlerlike cat and the older gentleman who cares for him. This particular adventure begins when the pair stumble upon a packed tent while looking through the attic. The ever-curious Findus asks what it is and upon receiving an answer pleads to go camping. Pettson agrees, thinking he'll enjoy a peaceful outing. Readers will thoroughly enjoy events involving some demanding chickens, a large pike, and an impulsive cat. Both characters have a distinct look. Pettson has a bulbous nose and floppy farmer's hat that suits his identity as a kindly guardian and inventor of funny contraptions. By contrast, Findus's energetic and often silly actions really stand out. Readers will easily locate Findus in his green overalls and beanie even in busy scenes. Each page offers vibrant colors and lush details to pore over. Items such as like the hidden fairy creatures and Pettson's cluttered home flesh out the characters and world beyond the simple text. VERDICT Young readers will be charmed by this book's quirky elements and engaging characters.&#x2014;Rachel Forbes, Oakville Public Library, Ont.</p><h2>Minding the Temple of the Soul: Balancing Body, Mind &amp; Spirit through Traditional Jewish Prayer, Movement and Meditation</h2><p><p>This new spiritual approach to physical health introduces us to a spiritual tradition that affirms the body and enables us to reconceive our bodies in a more positive light.

Body, mind, and soul are interactive and interdependent forces or vital energies. Each has its own purpose and contribution to our lives. No approach to health and fitness can succeed which does not ta ke into account the complexity of our being in this world. This means that our approach to physical health must be spiritual, and our approach to spiritual growth must be embodied. No spirituality can ultimately succeed without loving attention to the physical body.</p><h2>The Puppy Place #32: Liberty</h2><p>Welcome to the Puppy Place--where every puppy finds a home!<br><br>Charles and Lizzie Peterson love puppies.

Its implications as a thought experiment provide a starting point for urgently important thinking about the moral issues implicit in a hypertechnological society.

While people in Eastern Europe and the Baltic often drink it neat, swallowing it in one gulp, others use it in cocktails and mixed drinks&#x2014;bloody marys, screwdrivers, white russians, and Jell-O shots&#x2014;or mix it with tonic water or ginger beer to create a refreshing drink. Vodka manufacturers even infuse it with flavors ranging from lemon and strawberry to chocolate, bubble gum, and bacon. Created by distilling fermented grains, potatoes, beets, or other vegetables, this colorless, tasteless, and odorless liquor has been enjoyed by both the rich and the poor throughout its existence, but it has also endured many obstacles along its way to global popularity.</p>In this book, Patricia Herlihy takes us for a ride through vodka&#x2019;s history, from its mysterious origins in a Slavic country in the fourteenth century to its current transatlantic reign over Europe and North America. She reveals how it continued to flourish despite hurdles like American Prohibition and being banned in Russia on the eve of World War I. On its way to global domination, vodka became ingrained in Eastern European culture, especially in Russia, where standards in vodka production were first set.

The imagery that cycles through the poems&#x2014;fire, shell, highway, wing&#x2014;gives the collection a rich lyrical-dramatic texture. Each poem builds on a theme of searching for a lost &#x201c;self&#x201d;&#x2014;an &#x201c;other&#x201d; America&#x2014;that crosses biblical, tribal, and ecological mythologies.</p><p>In <i>Leaving Tulsa</i>, Foerster is not afraid of the strange or of estrangement. The narrator occupies a space in between and navigates the offbeat experiences of a speaker that is of both Muscogee and European heritage. With bold images and candid language, Foerster challenges the perceptions of what it means to be Native, what it means to be a woman, and what it means to be an American today. Ultimately, these brave and luminous poems engage and shatter the boundaries of time, self, and continent.</p><p>Foerster&#x2019;s journey transcends both geographic space and the confines of the page to live vividly in the mind of the reader.</p></p><p>Jennifer Elise Foerster has an MFA in writing from Vermont College of Fine Arts, a BFA from the Institute of American Indian Arts, and she was Wallace Stegner Fellow in Poetry at Stanford University.

Sensuous, generous, full of beginnings and endings, this map of America flapping in the dark meditates on Foerster&#x2019;s Muskegee ancestry, the American prairie, the loss of her grandmother&#x2019;s land, and her shard-like rediscovery in California.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tess Taylor, NPR<br><br> &#x201c;Foerster has her own voice and an ability to shift that voice to show past, present, mythic time, dream landscape and a myriad of other states of mind.

It is that place, between the worlds, so to speak, this in-betweeness, where words spoken have much to say and the words unspoken are left for a reader to fill. Poetry par excellence, then, poetry that has beauty, power of images and emotions, poetry that invites you to take a journey into the unknown.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sonja Kravanja, translator of Tomaz Salamun&#x2019;s <i>On the Tracks of Wild Game</i><br><br> &#x201c;Wow.

She was then awarded a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of New Mexico, followed by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. As Dr. Keller home schooled her three children, she was unable to find science textbooks that she felt would give her children a solid foundation in the sciences. Her scientific background, coupled with her desire to educate her children, led Dr. Keller to found Gravitas Publications, Inc. and to develop the Real Science-4-Kids curriculum. Real Science-4-Kids is a &#x201c;worldview-neutral&#x201d; curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the sciences and also gives them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Students are presented with up-to-date scientific facts and the steps of the scientific method, together with the critical thinking tools needed to help them evaluate scientific conclusions. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s books are as philosophically neutral as possible and do not impose any single overall philosophical interpretation such as Darwinism, Intelligent Design, or Creationism. Instead, they allow students to make up their own minds about what the data show. Real Science-4-Kids, with its engaging, kid-friendly text and easy to use teacher-friendly manuals, is used in home, private, and public schools in all 50 states in the US and in many other countries.

The story begins in 1969. From the outset of his tenure in the White House, Nixon was obsessed with the fear of being a one-term president. Emery meticulously chronicles the path of Nixon&#x2019;s slide into illegality that led from his initial approvals of wiretapping to leaks within his administration to the bungled attempts to plant bugs and copy documents in the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington&#x2019;s huge Watergate complex and the desperate cover-up.<br> <br>Emery&#x2019;s comprehensive coverage and penetrating insights clear up many uncertainties that may still remain about the scandal and the extent of Nixon&#x2019;s involvement.

Emery&#39;s comprehensive coverage and penetrating insights clear up many uncertainties that may still remain about the scandal and the extent of Nixon&#39;s involvement. Authoritative and compelling, Watergate is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand fully this traumatizing episode in America&#39;s history that challenged the integrity of its political system.To coincide with the 20th anniversary of President Nixon's resignation, Emery (consultant for a Discovery Channel tie-in and former London Times executive editor) provides some new details in engagingly retelling the ``compelling story of botched government.'' It may seem that the Watergate scandal should be well- documented by now, but many of the facts are still unclear, and the accounts of the principals often conflict. Thus, Emery tells a sometimes confusing Rashomon-like narrative, referring first to one memoir, then to another sharply differing one in recounting the major events: the Nixon administration's long-standing program of covert operations against real and perceived ideological adversaries; the bungled May 28, 1972, break-in by Republican operatives at the Democratic national headquarters in the Watergate complex; and the increasingly desperate cover-up by the Nixon campaign and by Nixon himself. But although Emery unearths some new tapes and discusses some new details (his major revelation is that John Mitchell attempted to enter into a plea bargain in which Nixon would be spared prosecution in return for Mitchell's guilty plea), his account clearly reestablishes what other Watergate accounts have demonstrated: that high-level officials in the White House were parties to the Watergate break-in and other secret and unlawful operations, and that Nixon himself was an early party to the administration's and the campaign's frantic (and for a time effective) obstructions of justice. Emery argues persuasively that Nixon's resignation, in the face of almost certain impeachment, resulted from a bipartisan recognition that his administration was guilty of uniquely enormous political crimes (Nixon would never have been in danger of being impeached without Republican defections on the House Judiciary Committee). A first-rate and clear exposition of a complex and bizarre episode that traumatized America and tested the vitality of its political system.

The prosecution&#x2019;s case, which resulted in a combined 106 years in prison for the three men, rested on the more-than-questionable testimony of a pre-teen, Ed Vernon. </p><p>The actual murderer was never found. Almost four decades later, Vernon recanted his testimony, and Wiley, Kwame, and Rickey were released. But while their exoneration may have ended one of American history&#x2019;s most disgraceful miscarriages of justice, the corruption and decay of the city responsible for their imprisonment remain on trial. </p><p>Interweaving the dramatic details of the case with Cleveland&#x2019;s history&#x2015;one that, to this day, is fraught with systemic discrimination and racial tension&#x2015;Swenson reveals how this outrage occurred and why. <i>Good Kids, Bad City</i> is a work of astonishing empathy and insight: an immersive exploration of race in America, the struggling Midwest, and how lost lives can be recovered.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2019:</strong> "This story is about more than three lives unjustly stolen; it's also about how a city can finally face down&#x2014;and fix&#x2014;its ugly past," says journalist Kyle Swenson about his investigation of three black teenagers arrested and convicted in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1970s for a crime they didn't commit. <em>Good Kids, Bad City</em> probes how these three young men became the victims of the sometimes overboiling racial tensions in Cleveland, and how a city's culture can sabotage justice. Still, a city's attitude is created&#x2014;and changed&#x2014;by the people who live there, and <em>Good Kids, Bad City</em> also celebrates the citizens who strive to make Cleveland a place they can be proud to call home. Much like Matthew Desmond's <em>Evicted</em> and Anna Clark's <em>The Poisoned City</em>, Swenson's connection to his subjects&#x2014;the convicted men and their loved ones&#x2014;is what delivers an emotional jab to the gut. This harrowing slice of urban dwellers' lives will affect readers who reside far beyond Cleveland's city limits. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, Amazon Book Review</em><b>KYLE SWENSON</b> is a reporter for <i>The Washington Post.</i> A finalist for the Livingston Award for Young Journalists, he is also the recipient of the Society of Professional Journalists&#x2019; Sigma Delta Chi Award for Feature Reporting.

Or has grace always been around and is the law forever?</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the ultimate destination of redeemed mankind &#x2013; heaven or earth?</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is there so much focus in the prophecy world on events leading up to the return of Jesus and so little about what follows?</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the central conflict Jesus has in the gospels and what was the great error of the Pharisees?</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it possible today&#x2019;s believers in Jesus could be making the same error as the Pharisees of His time?</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have Christians replaced Israel as the people of promise?</li></ul><p>Using Scriptures almost exclusively as a resource, Farah will shock and amaze most Christians with a clear picture of what the coming kingdom of God will be like. Such prophetic Scriptures and many others, closely matching the conditions of today's world, make a compelling case that we may be nearing this very special and long-prophesied time&#x2014;a time of great hope, but also of great deception. With so much attention by prophecy teachers on events to occur before the return of Jesus,&nbsp;<i>The Restitution of All Things</i>&nbsp;looks beyond that to His one-thousand year reign of earth. It exposes the spiritual traditions of men that often overshadow the commandments of God. It lays bare the pernicious lie that has become known today as "replacement theology."

This is the first book to apply the 2,500-year-old principles of Zen Buddhism to the modern struggle with the vicious cycle of dieting, losing, and regaining weight. From a Buddhist perspective, overeating is a disorder of desire. This book will teach readers how to find freedom from eating problems and the tyranny of desire that triggers them. Filled with concrete, practical exercises and the wisdom of the ages, The Zen of Eating provides, at last, an alternative to ineffective diet programs, products, and pills.</p><p><b>Ronna Kabatznick, Ph.D.</b>, was the psychological consultant to Weight Watchers International for nine years, and taught psychology at Hunter College, Queens College, and the City College of New York.

Championed by acclaimed news photographers like Arthur Fellig (a.k.a. Weegee), the Speed Graphic camera produced a new visual style that was as blunt, powerful, and immediate as a left hook.<br><br>Driven by the desire to fill newspaper pages with sensational images, press photographers shot everything, day and night: automobile accidents, fires, murders, all the cop news that fought for a hot spot on the Front Page. And they covered uncounted numbers of social affairs&#x2014;pictures called "grip-and-grins" in the trade: school events, sports, celebrities, oddities both of nature and humanity.</p><p>A woman stabs and kills her husband and then cradles his body--Members of the National Guard patrol city streets during a labor strike--A house lies in ruins following a natural gas explosion--A decapitated corpse sprawls on the ground in front of a factory--Terrified residents make their way down a fire escape as their hotel burns--A young woman stares into a mirror attached to her iron lung--With an eye for the picture that tells a story, Larry Millett has collected 220 of the best of these &#34;noir&#34; images. These newspaper photos that capture the nitty-gritty era of the Speed Graphic camera are like a slice of Minnesota life. Here are nighttime murders, car-crash victims, the St. Paul Winter Carnival, hotel fires, celebrities, drowning victims, union picketers, tornadoes, floods, the strange twists in everyday life, and the pre-urban renewal vibrant downtown St. Paul. Millett has also scouted out many strange and amusing photos from the supposedly &#34;happy days&#34; of the 1950s. &#34;Fat men&#39;s&#34; races, fall-out shelters, and fake &#34;ndian&#34;bands were among the strange rituals of the era.In the two decades after World War II, and especially during the 1950s, photographers from the St. Paul Pioneer Press and St. Paul Dispatch cruised the city in search of dramatic visual images. Equipped with the legendary Speed Graphic, a large-format camera capable of producing richly detailed prints, the newspapers&#39; dozen or so staff photographers took thousands of black-and-white pictures, many of them startlingly graphic. The photographers often worked closely with the police and had a remarkable degree of access to crime scenes and criminals. This allowed them to produce images--of blood-soaked murder victims, drowned children, bodies strewn around accident scenes, houses blown to pieces--unlike anything seen in newspapers today in a visual style that could be blunt and powerful.Strange Days, Dangerous Nights includes detailed captions that tell the story behind each picture. This book is unique; there is nothing else like it for the region.Visit the book at http://www.mnhs.org/exhibits/strangedays/index.htm&#34;The photographs in this book are endlessly fascinating . . . we get a taste of almost everything, from the hilarious to the tragic, from the silly to the murderously bloody.&#34; -- from the foreword by John Sandford &#34;Today, [these images] still speak to us through their vivid immediacy, their graphic exploration of the dark side of urban life, and their sometimes appalling richness of detail.

In <em>Drawn from Paradise</em>, world renowned BBC broadcaster David Attenborough and artist and author Errol Fuller share their passion for these breathtaking creatures, offering bird lovers and nature aficionados an enthralling collection of interesting facts and stunningly beautiful, very rare hand-painted images of some of the most exotic winged creatures in the world.<br></p><p><p>From the moment Europeans were introduced to the birds of paradise in the early sixteenth century, their unique beauty was recognized and commemorated in the first name that they were given - birds so beautiful they must be from paradise. Originally they were thought not to have legs and therefore never to land. Still very rarely encountered, even in their natural habitat of New Guinea, they are still birds that elicit sheer awe in those who are lucky enough to see them. <em>Drawn From Paradise</em> will showcase the magnificence and beauty of the birds of paradise as they have never before been seen, with more than two-hundred hand-painted images and sketches by the men who originally studied them and luminary artists such as Jacques Barraband, William Hart, John Gould, Rubens and Breughel, to name a few. The art comes from the private collections of the two authors and has been rarely if ever published. Not only will the book feature the beautiful Greater Bird of Paradise-a bird that was originally believed to have been sent from Paradise, and was thought to never touch the earth-but it will also present more than forty other distinct species currently recognized-each representing amazing differences in size, shape, and color patterning.</p><p>The introduction provides a brief history into the discovery of these illustrious birds, from how they were originally perceived and idolized by the natives of New Guinea, to the arrival of Europeans, who were immediately captivated by their bright, vibrant colors. The chapters are ordered according to the sequence in which the birds representing the various genera made their appearance in Europe (thereby highlighting the books educational aspect). Within its pages, readers will catch a glimpse of these birds through vivid, highly-detailed painting, as well as learn more about each individual bird and genus-comparisons and contrasts between the males and females, as well as between the different genus's.</p><p>A tour through art and history, with a good deal of ornithology thrown in, <em>Drawn From Paradise</em> is not only a must-have for ornithologists and bird-watchers, but also a beautiful collectible for students, artists, and aesthetes. Its central idea is to showcase the breathtaking beauty of these birds and the enormous interest that still surrounds them even today.</p><p>David Attenborough is one of the world's leading television broadcasters. His interest in the birds of paradise began at a very early age, leading to various expeditions to New Guinea to see them in the wild.

She became instantly famous with Maiden Voyage, the best-selling book she wrote about the solo trip. In over twenty years of cruising by herself and with family, and leading ten-day flotillas to charter destinations in a professional capacity, she has gathered many anecdotes, observations, opinions, cautionary tales and advice. Indeed, she has been around.<p> </p><p>She was hired as a columnist in 1997 by the fledging sailing magazine Latitudes and Attitudes. "Casual and friendly in its approach to the sailing world, the magazine's tone provided me with a place to explore my own reflections on what I already knew and continued to learn about the sailing way of life and how to share it all with others." In this, her first book since Maiden Voyage, there is something for the armchair sailor dreaming about sailing off one day, as well as for the sailor in the cockpit actively chasing those horizons.</p></p><p>* Tania Aebi's Maiden Voyage was a world sensation. Her first book continues to sell in many editions<p> * This is the first new book since those sensational beginnings</p><p> * A compendium of sailing experience and reflections by a hugely popular author</p>Tania Aebi was 21 in 1987 when she became the first American woman and the youngest person to have sailed around the world alone. She had no sailing experience when she started her voyage. She has since made sailing her profession. She is a columnist for Latitudes and Attitudes magazine and a frequent lecturer on sailing topics. Tania Aebi lives in Vermont.</p><h2>The Selfhood of the Human Person</h2><p>We often hear it said that "each person is unique and unrepeatable" or that "each person is his own end and not a mere instrumental means." But what exactly do these familiar sayings mean? What are they based on? How do we know they are true?<p></p> <br><p></p><br>In this book, John F. Crosby answers these questions by unfolding the mystery of personal individuality or uniqueness, or as he calls it personal selfhood. He stands in the great tradition of Western philosophy and draws on Aquinas wherever possible, but he is also deeply indebted to more recent personalist philosophy, especially to the Christian personalism of Kierkegaard and Newman and to the phenomonology of Scheler and von Hildebrand. As a result, Crosby, in a manner deeply akin to the philosophical work of Karol Wojtyla, enriches the old with the new as he explores the structure of personal selfhood, offering many original contributions of his own. <br><br>Crosby sheds new light on the incommunicability and unrepeatability of each human person. He explores the subjectivity, or interiority, of persons as well as the much-discussed theme of their transcendence, giving particular attention to the transcendence achieved by persons in their moral existence. Finally he shows how we are led through the person to God, and he concludes with an original and properly philosophical approach to the image of God in each person. <br><br>Throughout his study, Crosby is careful not to take selfhood in an individualistic way. He shows how the "selfhood and solitude" of each person opens each to others, and how, far from interfering with interpersonal relations, it in fact renders them possible. <p></p><br><p></p><br> ABOUT THE AUTHOR:<p></p><br>John F. Crosby is professor and chair of philosophy at the Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio. He has taught at the University of Dallas, the John Paul II Institute for Marriage and Family in Rome, and at the International Academy of Philosophy in Liechtenstein. Professor Crosby earned his doctorate in philosophy from the Universitaet Salzburg, Austria, studying with Josef Seifert and having Dietrich von Hildebrand as his master. <p></p><br><p></p><br> PRAISE FOR THE BOOK:<p></p><br>"This work is a serious philosophical study full of many rich insights that advance significantly our understanding of the human person."&#x2015;Norris Clarke, S.J., Fordham University <br><br>"Crosby makes an invaluable contribution to the future of Catholic philosophy and its intellectual culture in general. This book will become must reading for anyone interested in the relation of John Paul's personalism to the perennial philosophy and to neo-Thomism. For those interested in mediating that relationship, Crosby is their best guide."&#x2015;Deal W. Hudson, Crisis<br><br>"John Crosby's books, <i>The Selfhood of the Human Person</i> and the more recent <i>Personalist Papers</i>, deal with metaphysical primitives. This makes them important books.

She smothered a laugh before it betrayed to those around just how much she was looking forward to riding out of her father's castle. She gained the back of the mare, and the animal let out a louder sound of excitement. Brina clasped the animal with her thighs and leaned low over its neck.</p> <p>"I agree, my beauty. Standing still is very boring." Brina kept her voice low and gave the mare its freedom. The animal made a path toward the gate, gaining speed rapidly.</p> <p>Brina allowed her laughter to escape just as she and the mare crossed beneath the heavy iron gate that was still raised.</p> <p>"Don't be out too long... Dusk is nearly fallen..." the Chattan retainer set to guarding the main entrance to Chattan Castle called after her, but Brina did not even turn her head to acknowledge the man. Being promised to the church did have some advantages after all. Her undyed robe fluttered out behind her because the garment was simple and lacked any details that might flatter her figure. There were only two small tapes that buttoned toward the back of it in order to keep the fabric from being too cumbersome.</p> <p>"Faster..."</p> <p>The mare seemed to understand her and took to the rocky terrain with eagerness. The wind was crisp, almost too chilly for the autumn. Brina leaned down low and smiled as she moved in unison with the horse. The light was rapidly fading, but the approaching night didn't cause her a bit of worry.</p> <p>She was a bride of Christ, the simple gown that she wore more powerful even than the fact that her father was laird of the Chattan. No one would trifle with her, even after day faded into night.</p> <p>But that security came with a price, just as all things in life did. She straightened up as the mare neared the thicket, and she spied her father's man waiting on her.</p> <p>Bran had served as a retainer for many years, and he was old enough to be her sire. He frowned at her as she slid from the back of the mare.</p> <p>"Ye ride too fast."</p> <p>Brina rubbed the neck of the horse for a moment, biting back the first words that came to her lips.<br> "What does it matter, Bran? I am promised to the church, not betrothed like my sisters. No one cares if I ride astride."</p> <p>If she had been born first or second to Robert Chattan, there would be many who argued against her riding astride, because most midwives agreed that doing so would make a woman barren.</p> <p>Bran grunted. "It's the speed that ye ride with that most would consider too spirited for a future nun."</p> <p>Brina failed to mask her smile. "But I shall be a Highland nun, not one of those English ones who are frightened of their own shadows."</p> <p>Her father's retainer grinned. "Aye, ye are that all right, and I pity those who forget it once ye are at the abbey and training to become the mother superior." Bran turned and made his way into the thicket.</p> <p>Brina followed him while reaching around to pull her small bow over her head. The wood felt familiar in her grip. It was a satisfying feeling, one for which she might thank her impending future as well. Her sisters had not been taught to use any weapons. They were both promised to powerful men, and the skills of hunting would be something that those Highlanders might find offensive to their pride.</p> <p>She snorted. Going to the church suited her well indeed, for she had no stomach for the nature of men. She could use the bow as well as any of them. "At least I know that ye will nae go hungry." Bran studied the way she held the bow, and nodded with approval. "Those other nuns will likely follow ye even more devoutly because ye can put supper on the table along with saying yer prayers."</p> <p>"I plan to do much more than pray." Bran frowned and turned his attention to finding a good spot to hunt from. The burly retainer didn't believe her.</p> <p>That thought sobered her. She would have to leave soon, because the seasons were changing and the church was beginning to pressure her father for her. She didn't dread departing, beyond that it would be hard to leave her sisters, but she did detest the attitude from those around her that she was going to the abbey to do nothing but kneel in submission. Bran was correct about one thing, she would not be a mother superior who allowed the men who came to her church to act like savages the moment they received their absolution.</p> <p>"Those rabbits will nae be waiting on ye." Bran spoke up, his voice drifting on the wind from where he was perched in a tree. Despite the gray in his hair, he was still a strong man, and his legs with their knee-high boots were pressed against the bark of the tree to keep him solidly in position. His back was propped against a higher portion of the tree and his bow held steady while he looked back at her. Brina smiled at the challenge in his voice. "I plan to fell one before ye do."</p> <p>Bran chuckled and offered her a wink. "Ye sound like a lad."</p> <p>"What does it matter if I am less than feminine? Better that I am practical, for that will bring me more comfort in my life with the church, and it will see more good done if I am not delicate but might face injustice with my shoulders set firmly."</p> <p>Bran chuckled again. "For certain, it is a good thing that yer father has no' changed his mind about sending ye to the church, for ye have been raised too long with the knowledge that ye shall have no master upon earth."</p> <p>"Now ye are teasing me, for I know the place that shall be mine. I simply plan to make the most of it."</p> <p>"Aye, Brina lass, I can hear that ye do, and may God have mercy on those who try to cross ye, for ye will have none upon them."</p> <p>Brina shook her head and swept her skirts away from her ankles so that she might climb up the trunk of another tree and perch very much in the same manner Bran was.</p> <p>"I'd think that ye might be impressed with the fact that I intend to take to my place with such passion." Bran didn't answer, but something entered his eyes that looked a bit like pity, and she forced her thoughts on to her arrow and lining it up correctly so that she might be able to ignore the emotions that threatened to send tears into her eyes.</p> <p>She'd be a good mother superior. The best possible, because her father had given his word on the matter, and it was a poor daughter who shamed her father by refusing the place that he set for her.</p></p><h2>Drugs of the Dreaming: Oneirogens: Salvia divinorum and Other Dream-Enhancing Plants</h2><p>The first comprehensive guide to oneirogens--naturally occurring substances that induce and enhance dreaming <br><br>� Includes extensive monographs on dream-enhancing substances derived from plant, animal, and human sources <br><br>� Presents the results of scientific experiments on the effects of using oneirogens <br><br>� Shows how studies in this area of ethnobotany can yield a scientific understanding of the mysterious mechanism of dreams <br><br>Oneirogens are plant and animal substances that have long been used to facilitate powerful and productive dreaming.

Judith M. Bennett, who has been commenting on developments in women's and gender history since the 1980s, argues that the achievement of a more feminist future relies on a rich, plausible, and well-informed knowledge of the past, and she asks her readers to consider what sorts of feminist history can best advance the struggles of the twenty-first century.</p><p>Bennett takes as her central problem the growing chasm between feminism and history. Closely allied in the 1970s, each has now moved away from the other. Seeking to narrow this gap, Bennett proposes that feminist historians turn their attention to the intellectual challenges posed by the persistence of patriarchy. She posits a "patriarchal equilibrium" whereby, despite many changes in women's experiences over past centuries, women's status vis-�-vis that of men has remained remarkably unchanged. Although, for example, women today find employment in occupations unimaginable to medieval women, medieval and modern women have both encountered the same wage gap, earning on average only three-fourths of the wages earned by men. Bennett argues that the theoretical challenge posed by this patriarchal equilibrium will be best met by long-term historical perspectives that reach back well before the modern era. In chapters focused on women's work and lesbian sexuality, Bennett demonstrates the contemporary relevance of the distant past to feminist theory and politics. She concludes with a chapter that adds a new twist&#x2014;the challenges of textbooks and classrooms&#x2014;to viewing women's history from a distance and with feminist intent.</p><p>A new manifesto, <i>History Matters</i> engages forthrightly with the challenges faced by feminist historians today. It argues for the radical potential of a history that is focused on feminist issues, aware of the distant past, attentive to continuities over time, and alert to the workings of patriarchal power.</p></p><p><b>Judith M.

In one, I was a lesbian feminist, absorbed by activism at home and in the streets. In the other, I was a studious medievalist, training under the guidance of male professors, most of them priests, at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. Radical feminist by night, medievalist by day; feminist history brought my two selves together. As I recall, the reconciliation was less than perfect. Among some feminists I felt awkward about the elitism of my education, the snottiness of my diction, and the maleness of my chosen profession. And at both the Pontifical Institute and the University of Toronto I encountered a steady stream of students and professors who dismissed feminist history, not to mention abortion rights, lesbian self-determination, and the other struggles that nourished my political soul. But there was one aspect of the reconciliation that was always a perfect fit: I never doubted that my work as a historian was important work for feminism. In the 1970s it seemed crystal clear that one of the battlefronts of feminism was women's history, where feminists&#x2014;both in the academy and without&#x2014;were reclaiming a lost past in their research, empowering students in their teaching, and using historical insight to inform feminist strategy.</p><p>This book seeks to recover some of the clarity of that 1970s ideal of a seamless union of history and feminism&#x2014;and to add depth to it. In the thirty years since I first pulled a history book off the shelves of the Toronto Women's Bookstore, the history of women and gender has developed into a recognized academic field, institutionalized in departments, conferences, journals, and presses, and mature enough to participate in the creation of such newer fields as lesbian history and the history of masculinity. Feminism, even though it has waxed and waned in popularity, has also grown immensely, its theories becoming more sophisticated and inclusive and some of its tenets now realized in the legal codes, educational curricula, and everyday values of some nations; in the 1990s, for example, sexual equality was enshrined in the constitutions of the emerging states of Namibia, South Africa, and the Czech Republic. Yet, although both history and feminism have grown stronger over these decades, the relationship between them has weakened. Women's history once shone as a critical battlefront of the feminist struggle, but today it is often considered irrelevant: feminist media include much less history than they once did (such once-regular venues as the "Lost Women" column of <i>Ms. Magazine</i> and the "Archives" section of <i>Signs</i> are now themselves "history"); much feminist theory is remarkably uninformed by historical insight; and, most worryingly of all, some young feminists cavalierly reject the utility of the past, proclaiming proudly that "we don't much remember." I <i>want</i> to remember; I think that the achievement of a more feminist future depends on such remembrance; and I believe it is the particular job of feminist historians to ensure that those memories are rich, plausible, and well-informed.</p><p>I first began expressing my concerns about an eroding relationship between "feminism and history" in an article of that title published in 1989. In the years since, I have learned from the generous suggestions of readers and audiences, refined my thinking, and continued to reflect in print on developments in feminist history. This book borrows from some of these past publications but in ways that will often be unrecognizable. I have drawn my thoughts together here into a new argument about the depoliticization of women's and gender history, the loss of historical depth in feminist scholarship, the critical perspectives afforded by a long view of the history of women and gender, and the importance of studying what I call a "patriarchal equilibrium." In this process of rethinking and revision, I have formulated some new ideas and text, and I have also sometimes freely self-plagiarized from previously published articles. <i>History Matters</i> addresses some subjects entirely new to my process of historiographical reflection, and it also provides, compared to any of my individual articles, a more coherent and thorough statement of my hopes for feminist history.</p><p>In tackling the major issues of this book, I can speak, of course, only from my own experience and expertise. I teach in the United States, where I was born to nonimmigrant and middle-class parents of European descent and where I retain the privileges of citizenship; I pursued my graduate studies in Canada; I now spend a few months of each year in England, the country whose medieval history is the subject of my academic research. My perspective is, in short, profoundly "Anglo" in American terms or "Western" in world terms. These are the intellectual traditions within which I work and from which I draw most of my observations.</p><p>Although my examples will be largely taken from European history, my working assumption has been that the issues raised here are of general relevance to feminist historians. My familiarity with non-European branches of women's history is necessarily more limited, but what I know of the pursuit of women's history in other world regions&#x2014;particularly the United States, Latin America, Africa, Australia, and China&#x2014;suggests that, in these areas, too, feminist history is challenged by depoliticization, present-mindedness, and inattention to long-term continuities. Such challenges do, of course, play out differently in the histories of specific regions and times, and I certainly do not mean to imply that the history of European women should serve as a paradigm for histories of women elsewhere. Instead, I hope that readers of this book will consider both the European peculiarities of my concerns and the general trends of which Europe is merely one example of many.</p><p>Even for Europeanists, much of the historical information in this book will be new, for I draw the bulk of my examples from my own field of <i>medieval</i> women's history. Most historians of women, Europeanists or not, are unfamiliar with the history and historiography of the European middle ages. My focus on medieval evidence speaks directly to this book's contention that feminist history should be more attentive to premodern eras. In "getting medieval," I have endeavored not to dwell unnecessarily on medieval arcana and to offer examples that are clear, accessible, and to-the-point, even for readers unfamiliar with early Europe. I hope that readers will, in turn, open themselves to these earlier histories, thereby expanding their temporal perspectives on feminist history while also thinking in comparative ways about the field. This is not a book on medieval women's history; this is a book in which every incursion into the history of women is intended to help us think more generally about history, patriarchy, and feminism.</p><p>One last caveat. I have been told that anyone who begins a sentence with "we" is starting to deceive her (or his) audience, and I know that there are many circumstances that separate me from the diverse feminist historians who will, I hope, read this book. By using the first person plural, I mean to evoke our common feminist interest in the past, not to claim a common subjectivity. My evocation is practical and strategic, and it seeks to extend to "feminist historians" the implications of Iris Young's smart argument that we can conceptualize "women" as a serial collective, as formed by shared circumstance rather than common attribute or identity. Feminist historians are a sort of serial collective, too. We work in many national and institutional settings; we work on many subjects and centuries; and we work with tape recorders as well as trowels, in archives as well as streets. Feminist history is different everywhere&#x2014;it has been, for example, especially influenced by socialism in Britain, shaped by marxism in China, interested in women's culture in the United States, allied with sociology in Brazil, and fractured by "women" versus "gender" in Japan. These sorts of differences are a rich strength of women's history, and they need not divide us. In writing this book for feminist historians, in other words, I have seen myself as part of a diverse collectivity of feminist women and men who share a common interest in studying the past.</p><p>The argument of this book builds steadily from problem to solution to elaboration. The next two chapters lay the foundation by outlining the challenges that women's history&#x2014;a term which I will use as a shorthand for "women's and gender history"&#x2014;faces in the twenty-first century, specifically a waning of feminist connection in history (chapter 2) and a waning of historical depth in feminism (chapter 3). Chapter 4 suggests a way of approaching these problems&#x2014;that is, by attending more to the history of a "patriarchal equilibrium" whereby, despite many changes in women's experiences over the centuries, women's low status vis-�-vis men has remained remarkably unchanged. The fact of this patriarchal equilibrium presents, in my view, a critical feminist problem that only historians-and, indeed, only <i>feminist</i> historians who take a <i>long view</i> of women's past&#x2014;can unpack. The next two chapters offer in-depth illustrations of how deep historical study can enrich feminist understandings of women's work (chapter 5) and lesbian sexualities (chapter 6). The book is wrapped up with a chapter that adds a new twist&#x2014;the challenges of textbooks and classrooms&#x2014;to viewing women's history from a distance and with feminist intent. And a brief conclusion offers some final and (I hope) stirring thoughts.</p><p>Feminism has come a long way since the 1970s. As I look back now, I am amazed by some of the "truths" I then held dear, embarrassed by the differences among women I then overlooked, and ashamed by some of the ways in which my certainties then oppressed other women. But I remain as confident now as I was then that history is critical to the feminist project, that history provides feminist activists and theorists with long-term perspectives essential to building a better long-term future. I hope this book will help us think more explicitly about what <i>sorts</i> of feminist history can best aid feminist struggles in the twenty-first century. In the 1970s, feminists often turned to history for inspiring stories about great women who have triumphed over adversity and accomplished marvelous deeds. Today, feminists still mostly see history, when they turn to it at all, as an ever-expanding list of positive and encouraging role models: such women as Rosa Parks, Eleanor Roosevelt, Simone de Beauvoir, Susan B. Anthony, and, for those who take a longer view, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Olympe de Gouges, Mary Wollstonecraft, and perhaps even Christine de Pizan.</p><p>These women are certainly important parts of the feminist past and their inspiration does important work in the feminist present, but I seek in this book to encourage a more substantive integration of history and feminism, one that turns to history for <i>strategy</i> as well as inspiration. To my mind, the strategic lessons of women's history are more sobering than encouraging. Stirring tales of strong women who accomplished marvelous deeds against great odds may build self-esteem and confidence, but women's history, especially when viewed across many centuries, can also stimulate feminist outrage and revolutionary fervor. To whet your appetite for the "long view," here is one example taken from the pages that follow: in fourteenth-century England a female wage-worker earned, on the average, 71 percent of male wages; in Great Britain today women earn about the same&#x2014;75 percent of the annual wages earned by men. There are many ways to qualify this bald comparison and I shall do just that in chapter 5, but surely this "sticky" wage gap offers good information for feminists to think through. The feminist potential of this particular sort of women's history&#x2014;focused on feminist issues, aware of the distant past, attentive to continuities, and alert to the workings of patriarchal power&#x2014;is the subject of this book.</p></p><h2>Twice Born</h2><p>An internationally bestselling, acutely moving story set amidst the atrocities of the Bosnian war, Twice Born masterfully plumbs the depths of love, grief, and the all-consuming power of motherhood. Gemma hasn&#39;t been back to Sarajevo in sixteen years. She returns to teach her son Pietro about the city of his birth and the father he never knew. But the visit brings with it impassioned memories of her love affair with Pietro&#39;s father, their determination to have a child whatever the cost, and their deep connection to the city even as war threatened to destroy it. For fans of Jodi Picoult, Twice Born is a tale of the acts of brutality and generosity that war can inspire, and of the bonds of family fused in times of crisis.</p><p>Margaret Mazzantini was born in Dublin and now lives in Rome. She trained as an actress but left the stage to concentrate on writing. Her first novel, Don&#39;t Move, won the prestigious Strega Prize, and sold over 2m copies. Twice Born, already a blockbuster in Mazzantini&#39;s Italy, is optioned for a film starring Penelope Cruz.After the rain, the snails come out. They push their slimy boneless bodies out of their shells as they move along. After the rain, the inhabitants of Sarajevo go foraging in the treeless fields amidst tangles of iron and fresh mounds of earth. They bend over furtively, excitedly, to pick up the shiny little creatures. It&#x2019;s been months since they last ate meat. Then it rained, and today the women smile and unpack their treasure in their empty kitchens. The children smile at the sight of the snails climbing on and falling off the table. Like the others, Velida came home with a bag full of snails that she&#x2019;d gathered secretly, in an isolated park, because she was ashamed for others to see her hunger.<p>We dip our bread in the pan. A slightly cloying odor fills the kitchen. Snails cooked in Turkish spices, Bosnian vinegar and broth from the humanitarian packages. A delicacy.</p><p>Later Velida will blame this too-good food for having restored a happiness they hadn&#x2019;t felt for a long time, a misleading and harmful happiness.</p><p>Jovan&#x2019;s eyes were shiny, and there was a bit of color in his cheeks after months of rough grey skin.</p><p>After he finished eating, he lit a cigarette from a package Diego had given him. Drinas that they wrap now in pages taken from books because there&#x2019;s no more paper. Naturally, they started with books in Cyrillic. Jovan was sorry to see his culture going up in smoke, but how could he refrain from having a cigarette after a real luxury like a plate of snails?</p><p>Jovan went out when it was silent again, when Velida resumed chopping nettles and the good smell of the snails had disappeared forever.</p><p>He hadn&#x2019;t been out for months. He dressed to the nines in his wool vest, a wide tie and his old kippah on his head. He picked up the bag he&#x2019;d used as a professor and said he felt good and that he was going out for a walk.</p><p>Unreal words in that ghost city, in those houses without lights, without glass, the best furniture sold and the worst pieces chopped to bits for burning.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are you going, Jovan?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to the university.&#x201d;</p><p>Velida didn&#x2019;t have the courage to stop him. She&#x2019;d always respected her husband&#x2019;s wishes, and it hardly seemed the time to treat him as if he were under house arrest. She simply tried to tell him that the university had been shelled like all the other important buildings. Jovan nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go see if there&#x2019;s anything to be done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled and came out with an old Yiddish proverb.<i> If a man is fated to drown, he may die in a teaspoon of water</i>.</p><p>It was too late when Velida came to knock at my door, when it was already dark and past curfew and Jovan had been gone for hours. She wasn&#x2019;t crying, but her head trembled more than usual.</p><p>She was worried but still courageous. She had done the right thing.</p><p>Today, on a mid-November day, after a meal of snails and two glasses of homemade brandy made with rice from the humanitarian aid packages, the elderly Jovan&#x2014;a Serbian Jew from Sarajevo, a biologist whose field of expertise was freshwater species and who had spent his entire life studying the evolution of oligochaetes and of unicellular flagellate algae&#x2014;went out to take a glance at the wreckage of his city, at the destruction of his species, the peaceful species comprised of the Muslims, Serbs, Croatians and Jews of Sarajevo.</p><p>The dark ate away at Velida&#x2019;s memory lined face. She had no regrets.

With the solemnity of the coronation ritual completed, and the pomp of the banquet ended, this evening's celebration and merry-making came most welcome to the guests here within the King's Hall at Winchester. A pity that the crowned king had to be Edward.</p> <p>Emma sipped at her wine to disguise the flare of contempt. Edward, her firstborn son, crowned and anointed this day as King of England. She would have to learn to accept it. She took another sip, savouring the richness of the red grape as it warmed her throat, overcoming the taste of bile that rose from her stomach. Accept it, maybe, but she would never come to like it! Edward was as weak and shallow as his incompetent father, �thelred, had been. How well had the clerics who wrote the history of these things mocked that name! �thelred, <i>Noble-Counsel</i>-and how soon into his dithering, floundering reign had that been altered to <i>un-raed</i>, ill-counselled?</p> <p>A thunder of laughter from the far end of the crowded Hall drew her attention. Godwine's two eldest sons, Swegn and Harold, stood among a group of fine-dressed young men sharing some, no doubt lewd, jest between them. For all their faults-and where the Earl and his brood were concerned, there were faults a-plenty-they were sons to be proud of. Swegn might be wild, more interested in the pursuit of enjoyment rather than the demands of decisionmaking, but these faults were outweighed by better traits. All Earl Godwine's sons were strong, courageous and manly, aye, even young Leofwine, who was but seven years of age. Where was the manliness in her son Edward?</p> <p>Unable to keep her thoughts to herself, Emma spoke to the man sitting beside her, his hand tapping out the merry rhythm-beat of the dance on his knee.</p> <p>"I have been wife, and queen, to two men who have ruled England." Her wordsoozed contempt. </p> <p>"You would have thought one of them could have sired upon me a man worthy to be called son."</p> <p>"Harthacnut, your last-born-" Godwine began, but Emma irritably waved him silent.</p> <p>"My second husband, Cnut, gave me a child of each sex, both of whom had the constitution and life-span of a mayfly." Briefly, an expression of regret clouded Emma's face. To be queen for over two score years, to rule as regent, survive attempts of murder and the harsh bitterness of exile: such a woman needed to shield her weaknesses from those who would, at the drop of an autumn leaf, oppose her. But Godwine knew Emma well, better perhaps than either of her husbands. Harthacnut, her youngest son, she had genuinely adored. A boy like his father, wise and disciplined, with a sense of duty and purpose; strong of body and mind. How much had she endured for that lad! And for what? For him to die of a seizure when he was but three and twenty and crowned king for less than two short years.</p> <p>"The life of the wrong son was ended," she said softly. Godwine assumed she referred to Harthacnut's untimely death, winced as she murmured, "It ought have been Edward killed, not Alfred."</p> <p>Godwine made no comment to that. Emma had borne two sons to �thelred: Edward and Alfred, and Alfred was a name that still conjured difficult memories that brought the blood stealing into Godwine's cheeks. As young men, exiled from England, the brothers had tried and failed in a pathetic attempt to claim their right of succession after Cnut's death. Captured, the boy Alfred had been placed in Godwine's care. It had not been good care for the lad had fallen into the murdering clutch of Cnut's illegitimate son, Harold Harefoot. Imprisoned and cruelly blinded, Alfred had not survived the torture. Ever since, Godwine had carried the blame for that wicked death.</p> <p>But such was the fate of young men who tried to take by force a crown from the one who was already, rightly or wrongly, wearing it.</p> <p>Earl Godwine's hawk-sighted blue eyes followed Emma's narrowed gaze. Edward was an elegant fine-featured man, two years short of forty years of age, tall and slender, dressed in bright-coloured, extravagant clothing.</p> <p>Disdainfully, Emma snorted. "A pious weakling with neither brain nor balls." "Give him time, my Lady. He has been almost thirty years an exile. He was but eight when forced to flee to your birthplace in Normandy."</p> <p>Aye, it must have been hard for the lad and his brother Alfred, when they left London, muffled by the concealing darkness of night, bundled into a boat and taken, alone and frightened, across the sea to live among those of a foreign tongue and way of life. Never knowing when they would return to their mother, and England. Knowing, later, that when she agreed marriage with their father's usurper, Cnut, that the "when" would not come until the Danish conqueror met with death. And even then, only if their place had not been superseded by other sons.</p> <p>"Look at his hands! Too delicate to wield a sword," Emma announced with scorn. "I pity England if she is ever again faced with invasion. At least Alfred, for all his childhood mewling and whimpering, had the stomach for a fight once he was grown."</p> <p>Godwine refrained from answering. Alfred, as king, would not have survived beyond the turn of a season, not against experienced, battle-hardened men such as Magnus of Norway or Svein Estrithson of Denmark-those two Viking seafarers had always been far too concerned with England's affairs. But at least the roving greed of their ancestral cousins, Emma's kindred the dukes of Normandy, were of no consequence to England's future. The present Duke, William, was yet a boy. He would have problems enough keeping his head attached to his shoulders. With tact, Godwine commented, "Edward is amenable. He listens to his elders and accepts the wisdom of the Witan, his council."</p> <p>"He does not listen to me! I came into this world nigh on four and fifty years past. I have been Queen of England from the age of thirteen when I was wed to that weak fool �thelred. I ruled as regent for Cnut, when his duties as king of Denmark and Norway took him across the seas. I guided Harthacnut through his brief but glorious reign-yet this whelp Edward, the first-born son of my womb, publicly spits on me and calls me an interfering hag!"</p> <p>She glared at Godwine, but fell silent as the whirling dance finished amid laughter and excited applause. She watched as Godwine's sons were joined by a few of the breathless dancers, Harold swirling a fair-haired young girl into his arms.</p> <p>His sister laughed back at him, her eyes bright with youth and excitement, her cheeks flushed pink from exertion and the heat of the crowded Hall. Edith was a resourceful girl, determined to enjoy herself whenever opportunity presented itself. Watching her, one eyebrow raised, Emma had a suspicion that she might also have high-reaching ambitions, and the shrewdness to take full advantage of those offered opportunities. Pride was as ripe in the daughter as it was in the sons. Edith would make a good wife for some power-seeking young earl.</p> <p>Or...Emma sucked the inside of her cheek, then sipped again from her silvered goblet. Or perhaps Edith, only daughter of the noble lord Earl Godwine of Wessex, would marry higher?</p></p><h2>The Still of Night (A Rush of Wings Series #2)</h2><p>A Soul Stirring Novel Repackaged for a New Look<br><br>Though he is professionally successful, the one life Morgan Spencer can't seem to set straight is his own.

Simultaneously admired and vilified, he personified the rake-hell. Libertine, profane, promiscuous, he shocked his pious contemporaries with his doubts about religion and his blunt verses that dealt with sex or vicious satiric assaults on the high and mighty of the court. This account of Rochester and his times provides the facts behind his legendary reputation as a rake and his deathbed repentance. However, it also demonstrates that he was a loving if unfaithful husband, a devoted father, a loyal friend, a serious scholar, a social critic, and an aspiring patriot.

Symptomatic are the stories of duplicity pervasive in postwar Guatemala, as the left, the Mayan people, and the state were each said to have &#x201c;two faces.&#x201d; Drawing on more than twenty years of research in Guatemala, Nelson explores how postwar struggles to reckon with traumatic experience illuminate the assumptions of identity more generally. <p></p><p>Nelson brings together stories of human rights activism, Mayan identity struggles, coerced participation in massacres, and popular entertainment&#x2014;including traditional dances, horror films, and carnivals&#x2014;with analyses of mass-grave exhumations, official apologies, and reparations. She discusses the stereotype of the Two-Faced Indian as colonial discourse revivified by anti-guerrilla counterinsurgency and by the claims of duplicity leveled against the Nobel laureate Rigoberta Mench�, and she explores how duplicity may in turn function as a survival strategy for some. Nelson examines suspicions that state power is also two-faced, from the left&#x2019;s fears of a clandestine para-state behind the democratic fa�ade, to the right&#x2019;s conviction that NGOs threaten Guatemalan sovereignty. Her comparison of antimalaria and antisubversive campaigns suggests biopolitical ways that the state is two-faced, simultaneously giving and taking life. <i>Reckoning</i> is a view from the ground up of how Guatemalans are finding creative ways forward, turning ledger books, technoscience, and even gory horror movies into tools for making sense of violence, loss, and the future.</p></p><p>&#34;The struggle to understand violence is a consuming task for many around the globe. Diane M. Nelson articulates stunning insights into the problem of understanding the violence in Guatemala and, by extension, our whole world of war and structural harm.&#34;--Catherine A.

The cities span the globe, from San Francisco to Stockholm to Sydney, and each gets its own two-page spread filled with the iconic buildings, local delicacies, favorite pastimes, natural wonders and famous landmarks that make it unique. Simple descriptive words label the illustrations so that children can discover the many riches of these fascinating places, such as New York's Empire State Building, Rio de Janeiro's Carnival, Athens's Parthenon and Bangkok's pad thai, to name a few. Also included are the city's country, language and population. A world map on the endpapers marks each city's location, providing context and geographical reference. <br><br>Award-winning artist Benoit Tardif uses brilliant colors, a bold style and a touch of humor in his clever artwork that's sure to draw young children in for closer study. By collecting and presenting major cities this way, his book can help build global awareness, as it visually showcases the distinct differences as well as the many similarities between them all. It offers numerous opportunities for cross-curricular applications in the classroom, including in global studies, geography and language arts. With a wealth of information presented in such an engaging format, children will also want to independently peruse this book again and again. It's likely to inspire their curiosity about other faraway places and maybe even a desire to explore them someday!</p><p>Benoit Tardif started illustrating professionally after he completed his studies in graphic design at Universit� du Qu�bec � Montr�al. Since then, he has offered simple, effective and colorful images. Often tinged with irony, Benoit's style is marked by his interest in silkscreen and posters.

He converted the garage of a residential house into a studio and recruited teenagers from the neighborhood-like Smokey Robinson, Mary Wells, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Diana Ross-to sing for his new label. Meanwhile, the country was on the brink of a cultural revolution, and one of the most powerful agents of change in the following decade would be this group of young black performers from urban Detroit. From Berry Gordy and his remarkable vision to the Civil Rights movement, from the behind-the-scenes musicians, choreographers, and song writers to the most famous recording artists of the century, Andrea Davis Pinkney takes readers on a Rhythm Ride through the story of Motown.</p></p><p><b>Andrea Davis Pinkney</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than 20 books for children, many of them illustrated by her husband Brian Pinkney. She lives with her family in Brooklyn, New York.Gr 5 Up&#x2014;A tour of the musical powerhouse's history done with verve and panache. "The Groove" takes readers through the birth and demise of Motown, one of the most influential African American-owned enterprises in the world's social and musical history. Centering around Gordy Berry, the talented tastemaker and eventual mogul, the ingenious narration highlights the company's humble beginnings&#x2014;a pipe dream financed by Berry family's investment of $800&#x2014;and embeds the stories of the many legends and stars that were born in its studios into the social upheavals and landmark events of the time. From the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and the Vietnam protests of the 1970s, these important milestones are interspersed throughout, bringing home the important place Motown had not only in the proliferation of rhythm and blues, rock, and disco into American culture but also its integration into the African American identity. The funky and melodic narrative style never wears thin and the familiar conceit helps make the darker parts of history age-appropriate for the audience. The thorough and detailed resources, photos, time line, and discography will encourage readers to want to learn more about the well-known Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, and Marvin Gaye, and the not-so-well-known Funk Brothers&#x2014;Motown's official studio band.

This edition collects for the first time his poetry of five decades, including such characteristic achievements as &#34;Crow&#34;, &#34;Tales from Ovid&#34; and &#34;Birthday Letters&#34;. It also charts the parallel but less familiar story of Hughes&#39; private-press publications: a manifold activity ranging from broadsides and pamphlets to entire collections of poems, produced on small presses owned by the poet and his circle of family and friends, many of which have not previously circulated beyond their original readership. The &#34;Collected Poems&#34; reprints the ensemble of the published poetry, including those poems written &#39;within hearing&#39; of children which Hughes marked out for a separate adult readership, and the nearly two hundred uncollected poems which he published in periodicals but never reprinted. The various lives of the poetry are here integrated within a single chronology, and the notes give evidence of their interconnection, and of the extent to which revision was integral to this complex and copious body of work.</p><p>Ted Hughes (1930-1998) was born in Yorkshire. His first book, <i>The Hawk in the Rain</i>, was published in 1957 by Faber &amp; Faber and was followed by many volumes of poetry and prose for adults and children. He received the Whitbread Book of the Year for two consecutive years for his last published collections of poetry, <i>Tales from Ovid </i>(1997) and <i>Birthday Letters </i>(1998). He was Poet Laureate from 1984, and in 1998 he was appointed to the Order of Merit.&#34;&#39;This is a volume of quite astonishing authority - not just mastery, beauty and power, but sheer canonic authority&#39; Philip Hensher, Daily Telegraph&#34;</p><h2>Jesus in India</h2><p>The book deals with the escape of Jesus from death on the cross, and his journey to India in search of the lost tribes of Israel.

The author draws on his own experiences, on both sides of the grille, to explain what is actually happening in this sacrament, and why it is so helpful for growing in the love of God and neighbor. Because of so much recent confusion over the nature and purpose of the sacrament, the book tackles the common objections and anxieties over confession, and recommends frequent confession for getting rid of stress and anxiety, and growing in confidence before God.</p></p><p>"A clear, sound, eminently sensible exposition of the why and how of one of Christ's often-neglected sacramental gifts.

This cool-headed post-war reflection, from one of Nazi Germany&#x2019;s top panzer commanders, is rare enough.

Hitler&#x2019;s momentous decision to divert forces to Kiev and the south only came in late August 1941.

During Operation Barbarossa he commander Panzer Group 3 of Army Group Center, and toward the end of 1941 was promoted to command of 17th Army. In June 1942 he was given command of 4th Panzer Army. In 1943, following the battle of Kursk, he was relieved of command. After serving six years in prison following the Nuremberg Trials, Hoth turned to writing and died at age 85 in Goslar, Germany.<br><br>Linden Lyons holds a master's degree in history from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. He also studied German at the University of Freiburg and librarianship at the University of Canberra. He is passionate about languages, chess, and fencing, and lives in Melbourne with his family. He has also translated Panzer Operations by Hermann Hoth in the Wehrmacht im Kampf series, and is currently working on another translation for the series."Hoth&#x2019;s writing style is direct and to the point; yet it remains very readable and thought-provoking. He is a commander who cares very deeply about his soldiers and their well-being but also for the mentorship and development of his leaders... I would strongly recommend this book for any leader wanting to clearly understand what command (highlighted by bold, decisive action) entails in an operational context." (<i>Military Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The appendices include actual operational orders, but (unlike Guderian&#x2019;s book Panzer Leader) this is not a memoir - it is a masterclass in what happened and how to command armour.

The standard line taken by many German generals was that Hitler's decisions were almost always wrong, and if he had only left the direction of the war to them, then the result would have been different. Hoth, at least in the mid 1950s when this book was written, was more willing to admit that sometimes Hitler had a valid point, and some of his orders produced significant German victories.&#x201d; (<i>Historyofwar.org</i>)</p><h2>Brides in the Desert: The Spirituality of the Beguines (Traditions of Christian Spirituality)</h2><p>The Beguine movement arose in Europe during the thirteenth century and consisted of women living together in chastity and poverty, doing works of Christian charity. Although many of their number were wealthy, this urban phenomenon had no founder, no single rule, and no agreed way of life. The Beguine movement was part of a yearning to democratize religion, and it produced four great writers. Saskia Murk-Jansen, a specialist in medieval women&#39;s mysticism, looks at the lives and works of Beatrijs of Nazareth, Mechtild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch, and Marguerite Porete. These mystics used images, metaphor, and paradox to express the numinous aspect of God. They pioneered vernacular literature and forged theological visions out of their own experience. Their writings provide an invaluable supplement to the work of their male contemporaries. Saskia Murk-Jansen probes the key images in Beguine spirituality including the soul as the bride of God, suffering as an integral part of a relationship with the Holy One, and the desert as a place to focus on the transcendent. In this excellent, balanced treatment, Murk-Jansen clearly outlines the development of the movement, pointing to its influence as well as its repression by church authorities.</p><p>With no single founder, rule, or way of life attributed to them, the Beguines, members of a lay women's movement that flourished in Germany during the 12th and 13th centuries, generally lived in small, self-supporting communities, studying and teaching the Bible and working to alleviate poverty. In this excellent, balanced treatment, Murk-Jansen, a specialist at Cambridge in medieval women's mysticism, clearly outlines the development of the movement, pointing to its influence as well as its repression by church authorities, and carefully examines the lives and works of four key figures in the movement.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Path of Purification: Visuddhimagga</h2><p>One of Buddhism&#39;s foundational texts, the Visuddhimagga is a systematic examination and condensation of Buddhist doctrine and meditation technique.

Lizardi's experiment in subterfuge quickly failed: Spanish officials shut down publication of the novel--the first to be published in Latin America--after the third installment, and within four years Lizardi was back in jail.

Although many libraries will have individual biographies of these four figures, looking at their lives as they converged during the Revolutionary period does offer a focused and unique point of view. The format of the books makes them easy to read and digest. Paragraphs are spaced out, with subheadings over each chunk of text. The narratives are interspersed with images, which include historical drawings, paintings, engravings, and maps, as well as some contemporary photographs of monuments and locations. The authors state what is verifiable and note when historical accounts disagree. Sidebar questions in "What Do You Think?" boxes encourage readers to come up with their own ideas, especially about areas where historians must use conjecture. "What Do You Know?" boxes define terms used in the text that may be unfamiliar to some readers. Time lines, major-events lists, and "People at the Time" boxes also give readers extra support in understanding the context of the period.

How does a dog know when its owner is returning home at an unexpected time? Filled with captivating stories and thought-provoking analysis, &#34;Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home&#34; is a groundbreaking exploration of animal behavior that will profoundly change the way we think about animals, and ourselves. After five years of extensive research involving thousands of people who own and work with animals, Rupert Sheldrake conclusively proves what many pet owners already know - that there is a strong connection between humans and animals that lies beyond present-day scientific understanding.</p><p>It's rare for a book's title to say so clearly what the book is about. In the case of Rupert Sheldrake's latest work, the controversial content is right on the front cover. Pet owners will see it and smile in recognition; skeptical scientists will shake their heads and mutter about "maverick scholars." We all know of cases of dogs (and cats) who know when their owners are coming home, who go to wait at the door or window 10 minutes or more before their human arrives. Conditioned by the tight rigor of contemporary scientific thinking, we either look for rational explanations or we file the phenomenon away in our minds as "unexplained" and are careful not to talk about it with our scientist friends. <p> Sheldrake has shown in the past that he is not afraid to be labeled a rebel, thanks to his theory of morphic resonance, which suggests the following: </p><blockquote>Natural systems, or morphic units, at all levels of complexity are animated, organized, and coordinated by morphic fields, which contain an inherent memory. Natural systems inherit this collective memory from all previous things of their kind by a process called morphic resonance, with the result that patterns of development and behavior become increasingly habitual through repetition.</blockquote><p> Sheldrake believes that the "telepathy" between pets and humans, or between flocks of birds or schools of fish that move as a single organism, can be explained this theory. Sheldrake is less persuaded by anecdotes that suggest animal clairvoyance--warning of something in the near future--but refuses to disallow the possibility.</p><p> He accepts that the case histories he details so thoroughly in this book are anecdotal, but that makes them no less real; and as a scientist himself he sets up experimental conditions for studying this previously ignored phenomenon that show beyond any doubt that the phenomenon exists. He castigates traditional scientists for their refusal to countenance anything that doesn't fit in with their existing paradigms (or prejudices) and challenges them to come up with some more "acceptable" explanation--but none is forthcoming. </p><p> This fascinating book is a first attempt at a scientific investigation into a puzzling but quite common occurrence. One hopes that other scientists will follow Sheldrake's brave lead. <i>--David V. Barrett</i></p>who have ever owned a pet will swear that their dog or cat or other animal has exhibited some kind of behavior they just can't explain.

How do horses find their way back to the stable over completely unfamiliar terrain?

I experienced the benefit of such training myself, and applied it in raising my own family with the most satisfactory results. <i>Thomas Mellon and His Times</i>, p. 29 1 A THRIVING CAREERAndrew Mellon was the sixth child of Thomas and Sarah Jane Mellon, but he was only the fourth to survive infancy. His two sisters were already dead, and although he would not long remain the youngest son, he grew up among brothers only, in what Burton Hendrick called a &#x201c;eugenic&#x201d; family.1 Only the fittest would survive. At the time of Andrew&#x2019;s birth, his eldest brother, Thomas Alexander was eleven: the next, James Ross, was nine: and Samuel Selwyn was two. The two elder boys were close in age and interests: Andrew and Selwyn soon became a second pair, as would Richard Beatty (&#x201c;Dick&#x201d; or &#x201c;RB&#x201d;), who was born in 1858 and named for one of his father&#x2019;s oldest friends, and George Negley, who arrived two years later and was named for his mother&#x2019;s uncle. Even depleted by two early and wrenching deaths, this was a large bourgeois family by the standards of the time. But it was very much a Scotch-Irish Presbyterian household, and while Andrew Mellon knew far more comfort and security than most Pittsburghers, the atmosphere was intense and serious, rather than joyful or easy. Although surrounded by a lush and bountiful garden, the house at 401 Negley was gloomy and forbidding inside. For Thomas Mellon disdained the vulgar ostentation which he feared was &#x201c;common among those grown suddenly rich,&#x201d; whom he dismissed as the &#x201c;shoddyocracy,&#x201d; and his house was devoid of the elaborate ornamentation, both inside and out, that would became popular among the local plutocracy in subsequent decades. The blinds were often drawn, and the interior was a drab amalgam of Brussels carpets, heavy draperies, and somberly papered walls, with no pictures of any artistic merit.2 This was the morose world of Andrew Mellon&#x2019;s boyhood, but unlike his surviving siblings, he would continue to inhabit it as an ever more solitary son until he was in his mid-forties. Sarah Jane Mellon was the presiding matriarch, and although Thomas Mellon wrote little about her in his autobiography, she was clearly a redoubtable woman for her time. She was not only rich but tough, having survived eight pregnancies between 1844 and 1860. More conventionally religious than her husband, she was responsible for getting the family to East Liberty Presbyterian Church on Sundays. She also oversaw the household, baking the bread and cooking many of the meals herself. There was a domestic staff of three, including an intimidating housekeeper, Mrs. Cox. On the day of Andrew Mellon&#x2019;s birth, the housekeeper instructed James Ross Mellon to convey the news to his grandmother, Barbara Anna Negley, who lived nearby, and she soon appeared bearing a willow basket full of yellow apples which perfumed the birth room.3 Andrew Mellon&#x2019;s earliest recorded recollection was another scene of purposeful feminine domesticity&#x2014;which he disrupted. When two years old, he crawled beneath a table at which his mother and her sister were sewing, and began cutting the edges of the table cloth with a pair of scissors which had fallen to the floor. Given his father&#x2019;s &#x201c;high opinion of the strict exercise of parental authority,&#x201d; it is difficult to believe this misdemeanor went unpunished.4 From the very beginning, Andrew Mellon was at the center of that large and growing family over which it had always been his father&#x2019;s ultimate ambition to preside. These were generally prosperous times in Pittsburgh, despite another slump in 1857, two years after Andrew&#x2019;s birth, which lasted to the end of the decade: thus he was also at the center of a large and growing industrial region.5 Oil was discovered nearby in 1859, and the iron industry continued to expand. By 1860, there were twenty-six rolling mills, twenty-three glassworks&#x2014;and fourteen banks, all of which had survived the recent depression. With a population that had reached 50,000, the city ranked sixteenth in the United States, and Allegheny County as a whole claimed 178,000 inhabitants. Pittsburgh was also the birthplace of the Republican Party, which held its first convention there in February 1856: the Mellon family would be among its faithful for the next hundred years and more.6 In this buoyant, fertile environment, Thomas Mellon grew in wealth and stature. In 1857, the Allegheny County commissioners decided to double the real estate tax to pay the interest on bonds that they had imprudently floated to help finance railroad extension in the area. As befitted a lifelong opponent of tax increases and irresponsible speculation, an outraged Thomas Mellon helped organize public protests, and he spoke at many meetings. But his chief activities remained business and the law, at which he would work harder during Andrew Mellon&#x2019;s formative years than at any other time.7 Thomas Mellon continued to deal in debts, mortgages, real estate, and property developments, not just in Pittsburgh, but also more widely.8 In 1856, he took control from a defaulting mortgagor of a furnace property of 1,700 acres in West Virginia; it was his first acquaintance with iron production, but he chose against continuing operation because of the prohibitive costs of obtaining ore from nearby mountainsides. Three years later, he ventured more deeply into the coal business, and went into partnership with his wife&#x2019;s cousin, Felix Casper Negley. He financed the purchase of coal works at Braddock and Sandy Creek, but despite kinship, Negley proved an unreliable partner, and Mellon was later obliged to resort to &#x201c;vexatious litigation.&#x201d;9 This was not his only business association that would go sour, and in his autobiography he would lament that his judgment of men and character was defective, and that he was too trusting and easily persuaded. Much more successful was a partnership with John B. Corey, David Shaw, and George M. Bowman, all of whom became trusted lifelong friends. The group invested in numerous collieries, among them the Waverly Coal and Coke Company, and they prospered mightily. &#x201c;As to the coal business,&#x201d; Thomas wrote to his son James Ross, &#x201c;I consider it one of the best, and it is highly respectable.&#x201d; &#x201c;Coal,&#x201d; he would conclude, was &#x201c;the most important article in productive manufacturers.&#x201d;10 At the same time, Thomas Mellon&#x2019;s legal practice was growing, and here, too, he sought partners, among them William B. Negley, his wife&#x2019;s nephew. But again collaboration created more problems than it solved:&nbsp; &#x201c;I found it impossible,&#x201d; he later lamented, &#x201c;to transfer clients who relied on me to my partners, without losing them altogether.&#x201d; By 1859, he was feeling &#x201c;overwhelmed and oppressed&#x201d; with his increasingly &#x201c;taxing and monotonous&#x201d; legal work, but fortunately an opportunity to lighten his load presented itself.11 In April that year, he was approached by three powerful and politically connected friends&#x2014;Thomas M. Marshall, A. M. Watson, and Stephen Geyer&#x2014;who invited him to run for the new position of associate law judge in the Court of Common Pleas. With their help, he secured the Republican nomination. The recently established party was Mellon&#x2019;s natural political home: northern-based, pro-business, anti-immigration. But he &#x201c;knew nothing about party maneuvering and electioneering,&#x201d; and his dislike of the political process was such that he refused to campaign personally: &#x201c;I did not go out at all or appear in public,&#x201d; he later recalled, &#x201c;leaving electioneering in that line to my friends.&#x201d; They worked hard for him, and he won easily in the November election. He promptly dissolved his practice, and was duly sworn in on the first Monday of December 1859. Thereafter, Thomas Mellon was always known in Pittsburgh as &#x201c;the Judge,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Judge Mellon,&#x201d; and for the rest of his life, even after leaving the bench, he would dress in his formal attire from that time: a long-tailed frock coat and white shirt with a high, starched wing collar.12 For the next ten years, he shared the duties with a senior colleague (initially William B. McClure, whom he had met in 1838 at the prothonotary&#x2019;s office, and subsequently James P. Sterrett, who would end his days on the state supreme court), and they sat together, or separately, as they saw fit or as the pressure of the docket dictated, except in capital cases, where two judges were required. Previously renowned as a ferociously committed and determinedly partisan advocate, the Judge now moved with unexpected ease to Olympian impartiality.13 But in other ways, he remained characteristically forceful and unyielding. He had no qualms about sentencing criminals to death &#x201c;if they clearly deserve it,&#x201d; and he was predictably unsparing in his criticism of those he deemed to be hopeless or idle or failed&#x2014;or Catholic. He believed that there was &#x201c;entirely too much sympathy and consideration for criminals&#x201d; on &#x201c;the part of the unthinking multitude,&#x201d; and he soon became equally skeptical of the collective wisdom of juries. His initial inclination was to let the jurors hear the evidence and make up their own minds, with no direction from the bench. But he soon concluded that they were rarely capable of reaching a sensible conclusion about complex issues, and came to favor firm-handed direction from the bench. &#x201c;The judge . . . ,&#x201d; he later observed, &#x201c;may even go so far as to tell the jury how on the whole the weight of evidence strikes him: indeed it is his duty in most cases to do so.&#x201d; In later life, Andrew Mellon would have cause to remember&#x2014;and indeed to share&#x2014;his father&#x2019;s skepticism of jury trials.14 Although the Judge applied himself with predictable efficiency and thoroughness, he had been correct in anticipating that the job would be less stressful and demanding than his practice. With time on his hands, he was able to return to his relentless regime of solitary self-improvement which he had grudgingly abandoned after college. But since then there had been a revolution in political, theological, economic, and philosophical thought, as Bacon, Descartes, Berkeley, Locke, Hume, Reid, Stewart, and Brown were now joined&#x2014;and in some cases supplanted&#x2014;by Darwin, Spencer, Wallace, Huxley, Tyndall, Buckle, and Argyle, the &#x201c;deities now installed in the temples of philosophy.&#x201d; From among these new thinkers, Thomas Mellon particularly relished Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. He found it easy to reconcile the theory of evolution with the tenets of Christianity: the history of the world extended forward in a long a chain of cause and effect, while the great First Cause of it all remained unknown and unknowable. And he found Spencer even more congenial: in his insistence that life was a struggle which only the fittest survive; in his belief in individualism and laissez-faire; in his hatred of socialism and militarism; in his abhorrence of state interference; and in his stress on the need for practical, problem-solving education.15 Darwin&#x2019;s and Spencer&#x2019;s were transformative books for the Judge&#x2019;s middle-aged thinking in the way that Franklin&#x2019;s had been during his youth. The <i>Autobiography </i>had sketched out an individual course of self-help and self-advancement; Darwin and Spencer provided the broader natural and sociological vindication of such a trajectory. The Judge had experienced life as a struggle; they explained his experience. And so he determined to prepare his sons to fight and to win in their turn. Judge Mellon&#x2019;s mature, solitary self-education proceeded amid searing and stirring national events. Indeed, the events initially facilitated his efforts, for the Civil War broke out scarcely a year after he was elected to the bench, and the resulting decline in litigation gave him more time to read and reflect. But while he appreciated the opportunity, he deplored the reason for it. Although abolitionist sentiment was overwhelming in western Pennsylvania, giving Lincoln a massive majority in Allegheny County, the Judge did not feel strongly either way about slavery.16 He thought &#x201c;the Rebellion&#x201d; was another foolish armed conflict, characterized by &#x201c;imbecility and petty tyranny&#x201d; on the part of military officers and by &#x201c;folly and wickedness&#x201d; on the part of politicians. For war meant more government intervention, and more government spending, and this in turn meant more debt and more taxes. &#x201c;The waste and extravagance,&#x201d;&nbsp; he would later recall, &#x201c;indulged in by the state and local authorities in military affairs was amazing.&#x201d; He thought military service a great mistake, and approved of enlistment only among those who combined low class and low intellect, and who would not be missed if they failed to return. By contrast, he thought &#x201c;men of better qualities&#x201d; should stay at home, and &#x201c;the parents and friends of young men of promise&#x201d; should &#x201c;use all their influence&#x201d; to guard them from the mistaken temptations of &#x201c;military excitement.&#x201d; War, by Mellon&#x2019;s lights, was not a matter of glory and heroism and righteousness, but of waste and folly and ruin, and he lamented the death in uniform of his former foe-cum-friend at the Pittsburgh bar, Samuel Black.17 Whatever his feelings about it, the Civil War inevitably impinged on the Judge&#x2019;s affairs and on his family, making him &#x201c;gloomy and melancholy.&#x201d; His brother Samuel and his uncle Thomas both supported the Confederacy, but a cousin of Sarah Jane&#x2019;s, General James S. Negley, served in the Union forces. Cargoes of coal that the Judge shipped downriver to New Orleans were impounded by Confederate troops, and he could secure the $40,000 he was owed in the transaction only by calling on his connections with the war secretary, Edwin Stanton, who had been a fellow Pittsburgh lawyer before joining Lincoln&#x2019;s cabinet.18 But these were not his only anxieties. A ballooning national debt and rising taxes led the Judge to fear that the entire Mellon fortune might be wiped out, and that the family would have to leave the state; nothing of the kind happened. A more creditable worry was that industrial Pittsburgh would be a target for the Confederate army, and in 1862 and 1863 the threat seemed clear and present: &#x201c;our homes and property,&#x201d; the Judge remembered, &#x201c;were at one time in actual danger of destruction by the rebels.&#x201d; Trenches were dug and defensive earthworks constructed; they passed close to the Mellon house, behind the orchards. Andrew Mellon was not yet ten, but he vividly recalled the workers digging and shoveling, and he stood guard over the Mellon cherry trees with an unloaded shotgun. He also remembered seeing Abraham Lincoln in February 1861, when his train stopped at Pittsburgh on the way to Washington for his inauguration. When the president-elect rose to speak, he amazed the boy as he &#x201c;un-spiraled himself, like a snake,&#x201d; to a great height, and spoke in &#x201c;gentle and well modulated&#x201d; tones.19</p><h2>29 CFR 1910 OSHA General Industry Standards and Regulations</h2><p>July 2016 Edition Make compliance with dense government safety regulations simple with MANCOMMs 29 CFR 1910 OSHA General Industry Standards and Regulations.

Delany appropriated the conceits of sword-and-sorcery fantasy to explore his characteristic themes of language, power, gender, and the nature of civilization. Wesleyan University Press has reissued the long-unavailable Nev�r�onvolumes in trade paperback.<br><br>The eleven stories, novellas, and novels in Return to Nev�r�on's four volumes chronicle a long-ago land on civilization's brink, perhaps in Asia or Africa, or even on the Mediterranean. Taken slave in childhood, Gorgik gains his freedom, leads a slave revolt, and becomes a minister of state, finally abolishing slavery. Ironically, however, he is sexually aroused by the iron slave collars of servitude. Does this contaminate his mission &#x2015; or intensify it?

Like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, Wescott left the Midwest behind to live as a writer in 1920s Paris. In this novel, based on Wescott&#x2019;s own life and family, the young Alwyn Tower leaves Wisconsin to travel in Europe, but finds himself haunted by a family of long-dead spirits&#x2014;his grandparents and great-uncles and aunts, a generation whose young adulthood was shattered by the Civil War. Their images were preserved in fading family albums of daguerreotypes and in his own fragmented memories of stories told to him by his strong and enduring grandmothers. To disinter and finally lay to rest the family secrets that lingered insistently in his mind, Wescott writes, Alwyn was &#x201c;obliged to live in imagination many lives already at an end.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>The Grandmothers</i> is the chronicle of Alwyn&#x2019;s ancestors:&nbsp; the bitter Henry Tower, who returned from Civil War battlefields to find his beautiful wife Serena lost in a fatal fever; Rose Hamilton, robust and eager, who yearned to leave the cabin of her bearded, squirrel-hunting brothers for the company of courteous Leander Tower; the boy-soldier Hilary Tower, whose worship of his brother made him desperate; fastidious Nancy Tower, whose love for her husband Jesse Davis could not overcome her disgust with the dirt under his fingernails; Ursula Duff, proud and silent, maligned among her neighbors by her venal husband; Alwyn&#x2019;s parents, Ralph Tower and Marianne Duff, whose happiness is brought about only by the intervention of a determined spinster.<br></p><p>With a new Introduction by Sargent Bush, Jr.This story is based on Wescott&#39;s own life and family, the young Alwyn Tower leaves Wisconsin to travel in Europe, but finds himself haunted by a family of long-dead spirits- his grandparents and great-uncles and aunts, a generation whose young adulthood was shattered by the Civil War.</p><h2>Teresa of Avila: Ecstasy and Common Sense</h2><p>The words of Saint Teresa of �vila speak to the heart so directly that even four hundred years after her death she seems like our contemporary. Few people have ever written of the spiritual path with such immediacy, down-to-earth wisdom, and humor. Mother Tessa Bielecki has brought together here short selections from Teresa's collected works&#x2014;including <i>The Way of Perfection, The Interior Castle, </i> her autobiography, poetry, meditations, and letters&#x2014;to create a living portrait of Teresa and her exuberant spirituality. Teresa's striving for divine union was inseparable from her passionate involvement in the hardships and joys of the everyday&#x2014;which makes her an eminently worthy model for modern people who seek to integrate spirituality and the rest of life.</p><p>Teresa of Avila lived in Spain in the early 1500s. At age twenty, she joined a convent, giving up the idea of marriage as too enslaving for women of her day. Her time at the convent was not without its challenges&#x2014;first an illness overtook her for three years, and after she recovered she readily found many distractions from prayer. A profound mystical experience changed the course of her life, however, and she became the founder of many reformed monasteries.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Jack</h2><p>Beloved author-illustrator Tomie dePaola&#x2019;s take on traditional &#x201c;Jack tales&#x201d;&#x2014;in which a young hero ventures out to seek his fortune and gains it through luck or pluck&#x2014;is perfect for preschoolers.

Superstars&#x2014;including Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, and Ivy Queen&#x2014;garner international attention, while aspiring performers use digital technologies to create and circulate their own tracks. <i>Reggaeton</i> brings together critical assessments of this wildly popular genre. Journalists, scholars, and artists delve into reggaeton&#x2019;s local roots and its transnational dissemination; they parse the genre&#x2019;s aesthetics, particularly in relation to those of hip-hop; and they explore the debates about race, nation, gender, and sexuality generated by the music and its associated cultural practices, from dance to fashion.<p></p><p>The collection opens with an in-depth exploration of the social and sonic currents that coalesced into reggaeton in Puerto Rico during the 1990s. Contributors consider reggaeton in relation to that island, Panama, Jamaica, and New York; Cuban society, Miami&#x2019;s hip-hop scene, and Dominican identity; and other genres including <i>reggae en espa�ol</i>, underground, and dancehall reggae. The reggaeton artist Tego Calder�n provides a powerful indictment of racism in Latin America, while the hip-hop artist Welmo Romero Joseph discusses the development of reggaeton in Puerto Rico and his refusal to embrace the upstart genre. The collection features interviews with the DJ/rapper El General and the reggae performer Renato, as well as a translation of &#x201c;Chamaco&#x2019;s Corner,&#x201d; the poem that served as the introduction to Daddy Yankee&#x2019;s debut album.

In 1997, James E. Young was invited to join a German commission appointed to find an appropriate design for a national memorial in Berlin to the European Jews killed in World War II. As the only foreigner and only Jew on the panel, Young gained a unique perspective on Germany&#x2019;s fraught efforts to memorialize the Holocaust. In this book, he tells for the first time the inside story of Germany&#x2019;s national Holocaust memorial and his own role in it.<br><br>In exploring Germany&#x2019;s memorial crisis, Young also asks the more general question of how a generation of contemporary artists can remember an event like the Holocaust, which it never knew directly. Young examines the works of a number of vanguard artists in America and Europe&#x2015;including Art Spiegelman, Shimon Attie, David Levinthal, and Rachel Whiteread&#x2015;all born after the Holocaust but indelibly shaped by its memory as passed down through memoirs, film, photographs, and museums. In the context of the moral and aesthetic questions raised by these avant-garde projects, Young offers fascinating insights into the controversy surrounding Berlin&#x2019;s newly opened Jewish museum, designed by Daniel Libeskind, as well as Germany&#x2019;s soon-to-be-built national Holocaust memorial, designed by Peter Eisenman.<br><br>Illustrated with striking images in color and black-and-white, <i>At Memory&#x2019;s Edge </i>is<i> </i>the first book in any language to chronicle these projects and to show how we remember the Holocaust in the after-images of its history.</p><p><i>At Memory's Edge</i> is an ambitious and provocative collection of essays with topics ranging from Art Spiegelman's <i>Maus</i> books to, most notably, the Berlin Holocaust Memorial. Author James E. Young, an American professor of English and Judaic Studies, was the only foreigner and the only Jew on the committee that selected the design for the German memorial. His behind-the-scenes account of this project's development offers sophisticated answers to some very difficult questions. Young doggedly asks how Berlin can remember a group of people who are no longer at home there, and how Germany can--or should--remember the extermination of Jews once committed in that nation's name. The author's answers to such questions may appear excessively dogmatic to some readers. Early in the book, for example, Young asserts that "memory-work about the Holocaust cannot, must not, be redemptive in any fashion." But his rationale for such sweeping pronouncements is very persuasive. The book is also lavishly illustrated with photographs and architectural drawings that will be a great value to readers who accept the challenge that Young has assumed: "the task of contemplating how to understand a formative historical tragedy of which first-hand memory is rapidly fading." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"The brilliance of James Young's theoretical insights is matched by his outstanding knowledge of the vast array of representations of the Shoah and by his artistic and literary sensitivity. At Memory's Edge will become an influential book."&#x2014;Saul Friedl�nder "A valuable study."&#x2014;New York Review of Books "Young's book needs no extra boost, and yet this recent debate over the meaning of German nationalism gives his subject another dimension of topicality, proving again how accurately discussions of art can pinpoint all that's buried just beneath the surface of everyday life."&#x2014;Robert Leiter, New York Times Book Review "A beautifully written and illustrated book that tells us something profound about the featured artistic projects and their contexts."&#x2014;Natasha Lehrer, Jewish Quarterly "This book provides for further study of the nature and meanings of memory, and on the way contemporary artists contribute to the broad and growing discussion of what memory is." &#x2014;Jay Winter, Art Bulletin</p><h2>GM Full-Size Trucks, 1980-87 (Chilton Total Car Care Series Manuals)</h2><p>Total Car Care is the most complete, step-by-step automotive repair manual you&#39;ll ever use.

Sculpture is all around us: in public parks, squares, gardens and railway stations, as part of the architecture of buildings, or when used in commemoration and memorials and can even be considered in relation to furniture and industrial design. This book encourages you to consider the multiple forms and everyday guises sculpture can take.</p> <p>Exploring Western sculpture with examples from antiquity through to the present day, Mary Acton shows you how to analyse and fully experience sculpture, asking you to consider questions such as What do we mean by the sculptural vision? What qualities do we look for when viewing sculpture? How important is the influence of the Classical Tradition and what changed in the modern period? What difference does the scale and context make to our visual understanding?</p> <p>With chapters on different types of sculpture, such as free-standing figures, group sculpture and reliefs, and addressing how the experience of sculpture is fundamentally different due to the nature of its relationship to the space of its setting, the book also explores related themes, such as sculpture&#x2019;s connection with architecture, drawing and design, and what difference changing techniques can make to the tactile and physical experience of sculpture.</p> <p>Richly illustrated with over 200 images, including multiple points of view of three dimensional works, examples include the Riace bronzes, Michelangelo&#x2019;s <i>David</i>, Canova&#x2019;s <i>The Three Graces</i>, medieval relief sculptures, war memorials and works from modern and contemporary artists, such as Henry Moore, Cornelia Parker and Richard Serra, and three-dimensional designers like Thomas Heatherwick.</p> <p>A glossary of critical and technical terms, further reading and questions for students, make this the ideal companion for all those studying, or simply interested in, sculpture.</p></p><p><p><strong>Mary Acton</strong> was Course Director of the Undergraduate Diploma and Advanced Diploma in the History of Art at Continuing Education, University of Oxford.

Simple, Simple to his fans, made weekly appearances beginning in 1943 in Langston Hughes' column in the Chicago Defender. Simple may have shared his readers feelings of loss and dispossession, but he also cheered them on with his wonderful wit and passion for life.</p></p><p><p><b>Langston Hughes</b> (1902-67) was born in Joplin, Missouri, was educated at Lincoln University, and lived for most of his life in New York City. He is best known as a poet, but he also wrote novels, biography, history, plays, and children's books. Among his works are two volumes of memoirs, <i>The Big Sea</i> and <i>I Wonder as I Wander</i>, and two collections of Simple stories, <i>The Best of Simple </i>and <i>The Return of Simple</i>.</p>PART ONEWOMEN IN SIMPLE&#x2019;S LIFERemembrances&#x201c;THE first time I was in love,&#x201d; said Simple, &#x201c;I was in love stone-dead-bad&#x2014;because I had it, and it had me, and it was the most! Love! When I look back on it now, that girl couldn&#x2019;t have been good-looking. When I look back on it now, she couldn&#x2019;t have been straight. And when I look back on it now, I must have been simple&#x2014;which I were. But then I did not know what I know today. At that time I had not been beat, betrayed, misled, and bled by womens. I thought then, if I just had that girl for mine and she had me for hers, heaven on earth would be.&#x201d;&#x201c;Why do you choose to recall all that tonight in this bar?&#x201d; I asked.&#x201c;Because I am thinking on my youthhood,&#x201d; said Simple.&#x201c;How old exactly are you?&#x201d;&#x201c;I am going into my something-or-other year,&#x201d; said Simple. &#x201c;Tonight is nearly my birthday, and if you are my friend, you will buy me a drink.&#x201d;&#x201c;I have bought you so many drinks on nights which were not your birthday before! Anyhow, what&#x2019;ll it be&#x2014;beer?&#x201d;&#x201c;Same old thing,&#x201d; said Simple. &#x201c;I do not want to go home to Joyce with whiskey on my breath. Gimme beer. Joyce is my wife, my life, my one and all, my first to last, and the last woman I intend to clasp! But sometimes I still think about that first little old girl I were really in love with down in Virginia when I were nothing but a boy. She were older than me, that girl, but only by a year. She were darker than me, too, if that be possible. And she were sweeter than a berry on the vine. My Aunt Lucy did not approve of her because her mama had been put out of church on account of sin. But I loved that girl! I&#x2019;ll tell the world I did!&#x201d;&#x201c;I gather your romance came to naught,&#x201d; I said.&#x201c;Our romance came to naught, but she weights two hundred and ten pounds now, so I have heard, and has been married twice,&#x201d; said Simple. &#x201c;But she were the first person except Aunt Lucy who made me feel like somebody wanted me in this world, relatives included. Everybody else was always telling me, &#x2018;I am your mother, but your father went off and left you on my hands!&#x2019; Or else, &#x2018;I am your father, but your mother ain&#x2019;t no good!&#x2019; Or, &#x2018;Your poor old aunt loves you, Jesse, but your papa nor mama ain&#x2019;t sent a dime here to feed you since last March.&#x2019;&#x201c;But this girl ain&#x2019;t never said nothing like that. She just said, &#x2018;Jesse B., you was meant for me.&#x2019;&#x201c;I said, &#x2018;Baby, let&#x2019;s get with it.&#x2019; And we did, until the old folks broke it up.&#x201c;I had nothing, neither did she. So her mama said, &#x2018;Let my daughter be.&#x2019;&#x201c;My Aunt Lucy allowed as how I were too young to be going steady, anyhow&#x2014;that I must be getting too big for my britches, telling her I knew my own mind. About that time they sent me to stay with Uncle Tige out in the country, so I did not see Lorna Jean any more, until I were passing through Richmond on my way North, running away from where I ain&#x2019;t been back since. At which time, I were only interested in getting North. Now here I is this evening, tonight on my birthday eve, remembering a girl I have not seen in twenty-five years, but who were once my sputnik. I wonder do Lorna Jean ever think of me as I think of her, and do she have remembrances?&#x201c;Whilst I were living with Uncle Tige, I met another girl named Elroyce. I did not fall in love with her&#x2014;just sort of liked her a little bit. She were fun to go around with. Once I took her to a dance, and when I took her home, her door were locked. In that day and time down in Virginia, nobody locked doors, there being no robbers then. But her mama had locked her door, lights out, house dark. It looked like nobody lived there, house empty, as if she did not have a daughter who had gone to a dance. It were embarrassing to that young girl to have to wake up them old folks to get in. Besides, it was not <i>that</i> late. That young girl&#x2019;s parents told her to be home at midnight. It were only just a little after one o&#x2019;clock when we got there. That music was so good we forgot about time.&#x201c;It might maybe have been my fault we was late, because her mama told me I could take that girl out, but she said, &#x2018;Boy, you get my chile back home here by twelve o&#x2019;clock. If you don&#x2019;t, it will be you and me!&#x2019; The way things turned out, it were me and her. That old lady tried to ruin my life.&#x201d;&#x201c;The night of the dance?&#x201d; I asked.&#x201c;No, not the night of the dance,&#x201d; said Simple; &#x201c;nine months later.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; I said.&#x201c;It were worse than &#x2018;oh,&#x2019;&#x201d; said Simple, &#x201c;because I had not touched that girl. I were just a young teen-age boy myself. All I did was kiss Elroyce once or twice on the way home from that dance, from which we walked in the night in the springtime in the sweet and scented air. But the next week, I fell for another girl&#x2014;you know how young folks is. Yet come that following fall, Elroyce&#x2019;s mama sent for me.&#x201c;&#x2018;Is you the father of her chile?&#x2019;&#x201c;&#x2018;What child?&#x2019;&#x201c;&#x2018;You see my daughter, don&#x2019;t you? Her chile.&#x2019;&#x201c;&#x2018;No, ma&#x2018;am.&#x2019;&#x201c;&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t lie,&#x2019; says Mama. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you lie to me about Elroyce!&#x2019;&#x201c;I do not know why they always assumes the man is lying. It turned out that girl were secretly in love with me, so Elroyce told her mama I were the father of her child. Before God, I swear to this day I were not. It could not be. I had not touched her. But I left town. That is when I come North to Baltimore. It were not my offspring.&#x201d;&#x201c;Why bring up such unpleasant memories tonight?&#x201d;&#x201c;Because her child would be twenty-five years old this year, and I wonder what he looks like.&#x201d;&#x201c;How do you know it was a boy?&#x201d; I asked.&#x201c;It would have been a boy if I was its father,&#x201d; said Simple. &#x201c;I would not know what to do with a girt&#x2014;daughter&#x2014;was I to have a girl&#x2014;when she got teen-age. I would be afraid of springtime and dances and being out late for her, too, like that girl&#x2019;s parents was, if I was a father. But I would not never lock my door on no child of mine, no matter how late they come home. The <i>home</i> door, the door of home, should always be open always&#x2014;else do not call it home. Rich folks&#x2019; doors is locked. White folks&#x2019; doors is locked. But the door to home should never be. If I had a child that stayed out all night and all day and the next day and all week, I would not lock my door against her&#x2014;or him&#x2014;be he boy or girl, I would not lock the door.&#x201d;&#x201c;Since you are not a parent, you are just theorizing,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The hard realities of how to control teen-age children in this day and age baffle most people. I am sure they would baffle you.&#x201d;&#x201c;I baffles not easy,&#x201d; said Simple. &#x201c;I remember how when I were in my teens, my folks did not so much lock their doors at night, but they locked their hearts. They did not try to understand me. Old folks in them days was a thousand miles and a thousand years away from their children, anyhow. I lived in the same house&#x2014;but not <i>with</i> them, if you get what I mean. I do not believe, in this day and time, there is such a high wall between old and young. Do you think so?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I think there is&#x2014;and always will be. Unfortunately, the gulf between the generations is a perennial one. Take rock and roll: the old folks hate it, the young folks love it.&#x201d;&#x201c;I must not be very old, then,&#x201d; said Simple. &#x201c;I like rock and roll myself.&#x201d;&#x201c;Perhaps you are just retarded,&#x201d; I said.&#x201c;Which is better,&#x201d; said Simple, &#x201c;than being discarded. I wish me and my wife had seven children.&#x201d;&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I said.&#x201c;So we could always keep an open door,&#x201d; said Simple.Copyright � 1994 by Ramona Bass and Arnold Rampersad, executors of the estate of Langston Hughes</p><h2>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland &amp; Through the Looking-Glass (Macmillan Collector's Library)</h2><p><p><b>Selected for <i>The Great American Read</i>, the PBS series celebrating America&#x2019;s 100 most-loved books.</b></p><p>It's a warm summer's afternoon when young Alice first tumbles down the rabbit hole and into the adventures in Wonderland that have kept readers spellbound for more than 150 years. </p><p>Part of the Macmillan Collector&#x2019;s Library; a series of stunning, clothbound, pocket sized classics with gold foiled edges and ribbon markers. These beautiful books make perfect gifts or a treat for any book lover. This edition is brought to life by Sir John Tenniel's legendary illustrations in black and white, and with an afterword by Anna South.</p><p>Collected here are Lewis Carroll's two classics - <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> and <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> - in which Alice encounters the laconic Cheshire Cat, the anxious White Rabbit and the terrifying Red Queen, as well as a host of other outlandish and charming characters.</p></p><p>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, celebrated under his pseudonym Lewis Carroll, was born in 1832, the third in a large and talented family of eleven children. His fascination with word games, puzzles and writing was evident from an early age. He was educated at Rugby School and then Christ Church, Oxford, where he was later appointed lecturer in mathematics and subsequently spent the rest of his life there. Alongside his academic life he pursued a career both as a writer and an accomplished amateur photographer. His most famous works are <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> (1865), its sequel <i>Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There </i>(1871) and <i>The Hunting of the Snark</i> (1876). He died, unmarried, in 1898.</p><h2>The Song of Roland</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Song of Roland</em>, one of the earliest medieval epic poems, was written in France in about 1100. The poem is based on an incident during Charlemagne&#x2019;s wars against Muslims in Spain. Charlemagne puts his nephew, Count Roland, in charge of the rearguard as French knights retreat. The rearguard is attacked by a much larger Arab army, and Roland waits too long to summon Charlemagne&#x2019;s help.</strong></p> No king, no captain ever stood with better. Roland looks up on the mountains and slopes, sees the French dead, so many good men fallen, and weeps for them, as a great warrior weeps: &#x201c;Barons, my lords, may God give you his grace, may he grant Paradise to all your souls, make them lie down among the holy flowers. I never saw better vassals than you. All the years you&#x2019;ve served me, and all the times, the mighty lands you conquered for Charles our King! The Emperor raised you for this terrible hour! Land of France, how sweet you are, native land, laid waste this day, ravaged, made a desert. Barons of France, I see you die for me, and I, your lord&#x2015;I cannot protect you.

No other series of study and solution guides has come close to the Problem Solvers in usefulness, quality, and effectiveness. Educators consider the Problem Solvers the most effective series of study aids on the market. Students regard them as most helpful for their school work and studies. With these books, students do not merely memorize the subject matter, they really get to understand it. Each Problem Solver is over 1,000 pages, yet each saves hours of time in studying and finding solutions to problems. These solutions are worked out in step-by-step detail, thoroughly and clearly. Each book is fully indexed for locating specific problems rapidly. Detailed treatment of topics in statics, friction, kinematics, dynamics, energy relations, impulse and momentum, systems of particles, variable mass systems, and three-dimensional rigid body analysis. Among the advanced topics are moving coordinate frames, special relativity, vibrations, deformable media, and variational methods.<br></p><p>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK<br><br> This book can be an invaluable supplement to standard textbooks for students studying mechanics. The book is divided into 26 chapters, each dealing with a separate topic. The subject matter is developed beginning with statics and extending through friction, kinematics, impulse and momentum, systems of particles, rigid body kinetics, and vibrations. Sections on three-dimensional dynamics, moving coordinate frames, special relativity, and variational methods have also been included. An extensive number of applications have been included, since they appear to be most troublesome to students. <br><br>HOW TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND<br>A TOPIC THOROUGHLY<br><br> 1. Refer to your class text and read the section pertaining to the topic. You should become acquainted with the principles discussed there. These principles, however, initially may not be clear to you.<br><br> 2. Locate the topic you are looking for by referring to the Table of Contents in the front of the book.<br><br> 3. Turn to the page where the topic begins and review the problems under each topic, in the order given. For each topic, the problems are arranged in order of complexity, from the simplest to the more difficult. Some problems may appear similar to others, but each problem has been selected to illustrate a different point or solution method.<br> To learn and understand a topic thoroughly and retain its contents, it will be generally necessary for students to review the problems several times. Repeated review is essential in order to gain experience in recognizing the principles that should be applied, and to select the best solution technique.<br><br>HOW TO FIND A PARTICULAR PROBLEM<br><br> To locate one or more problems related to particular subject matter, refer to the index. In using the index, be certain to note that the numbers given there refer to problem numbers, not page numbers. This arrangement of the index is intended to facilitate finding a problem more rapidly, since two or more problems may appear on a page.<br><br> If a particular type of problem cannot be found readily, it is recommended that the student refer to the Table of Contents, and then turn to the chapter which is applicable to the problem being sought. By scanning or glancing at the material that is boxed, it will generally be possible to find problems related to the one being sought, without consuming considerable time. After the problems have been located, the solutions can be reviewed and studied in detail.<br><br> For the purpose of locating problems rapidly, students shouldacquaint themselves with the organization of the book as found in the Table of Contents.<br><br> In preparing for an exam, it is useful to find the topics to be covered in the exam from the Table of Contents, and then review the problems under those topics several times. This should equip the student with what might be needed for the exam.<br></p><h2>I&#39;m Not Hanging Noodles on Your Ears and Other Intriguing Idioms From Around the World</h2><p>"I&#x2019;m not hanging noodles on your ears."

He reflected on the great themes of existence in his wise and engaging writings, his subjects ranging from proper conversation and good reading, to the raising of children and the endurance of pain, from solitude, destiny, time, and custom, to truth, consciousness, and death. Having stood the test of time, his essays continue to influence writers nearly five hundred years later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also included in this complete edition of his works are Montaigne&#x2019;s letters and his travel journal, fascinating records of the experiences and contemplations that would shape and infuse his essays.

Frame has kept everything.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEWMichel Eyquem, Seigneur de Montaigne, was born in 1533, the son and heir of Pierre, Seigneur de Montaigne (two previous children dying soon after birth). He was brought up to speak Latin as his mother tongue and always retained a Latin turn of mind; though he knew Greek, he preferred to use translations. After studying law he eventually became counselor to the Parlement of Bordeaux. He married in 1565. In 1569 he published his French version of the&nbsp;<i>Natural Theology</i>&nbsp;of Raymond Sebond; his&nbsp;<i>Apology</i>&nbsp;is only partly a defense of Sebond and sets skeptical limits to human reasoning about God, man and nature. He retired in 1571 to his lands at Montaigne, devoting himself to reading and reflection and to composing his&nbsp;<i>Essays</i>&nbsp;(first version, 1580). He loathed the fanaticism and cruelties of the religious wars of the period, but sided with Catholic orthodoxy and legitimate monarchy. He was twice elected Mayor of Bordeaux (1581 and 1583), a post he held for four years. He died at Montaigne (1592) while preparing the final, and richest, edition of his&nbsp;<i>Essays.</i></p><h2>An Affair to Remember: The Remarkable Love Story of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy</h2><p>The author of Jack and Jackie draws on numerous interviews with the inveterate actress to reveal new and poignant insights into a great relationship of Katharine Hepburn&#39;s life, her long-time love affair with the legendary Spencer Tracy.

Part A considers the question "what is insurance law". Part B considers issues germane to the establishment of the contractual relationship between insurer and insured. Part C considers issues relevant to the performance of contractual obligations.

The vocal score presents with great clarity the standard version that we all know and love, complete with a new, practical piano reduction. The appendix contains Handel's alternative movements and transpostions. The full score includes all the alternative movements and transpositions in their correct sequence and all material is signposted clearly and cross-referenced with the vocal score.<br>Vocal scores and orchestral material are also available on hire.</p><p>[Clifford Barlett's] new edition of Handel's Messiah. . . scores high marks for the care taken to present what Bartlett describes as a 'standard version of the work . . . The practical advantages of the full score derive mainly from the clarity of its typography, the economy of sides occupied by what elsewhere often involves a succession of irritating page turns, and a sense that the whole enterprise has been coaxed through the press with maximum care. Likewise, the vocal score is uncluttered and easy to use. * Early Music Today Aug 99 * . . . For organists/pianists who have for many years done battle with various versions of the accompaniment to Messiah . . . Timothy Morris's piano reduction will be eagerly scrutinized. This is clearly not a 'made easy' version, not a simple reduction to a skeleton of Handel's lively orchestral textures, but it is a lot more playable than commercially available adaptations hitherto . . . Publishing standards are high, clarity ideal, cost (of the vocal score at least) extremely good. In short, this is an excellent new performing score of a key choral work, edited in the light of modern performance practice influenced but not overwhelmed by the authenticity movement. A most finished piece of Musick indeed. * Organists Review May 99 * . . . provides the musician with a reliable, well-edited score of a performing version, I cannot imagine this could be bettered . . . Not before have all the rich additional material and revisions been included so accessibly in a single edition . . . They also have some hugely useful suggestions for performance and information about conventions and textual history from the editor What is impressive is the breadth of information that is presented in user-friendly terms . . . This is certainly an extremely helpful and practical edition which will serve as a very useful resource for performer and scholar alike. * Early Music May 99 * Indeed the OUP version is notable for its economy. It is clear, uncluttered and as near as possible to what Handel wrote . . . All users will find the Introduction to the vocal score interesting. The choral conductor will find additional information and helpful, practical guidance in the full score . . . Mention of orchestral parts brings me to an important characteristic of the whole of this edition - clarity, and a felling of spaciousness. Players welcome this, and for the orchestral librarian of the Northern Sinfonia, the orchestra in the Huddersfield launch the parts are the clearest he has worked with in 35 years experience. . . . This is undoubtedly a quality production. If a choir is contemplating a new set of Messiah (and the scores and parts are readily compatiible with other editions) this one must be at the top of the shortlist. * Howard Layfield, Mastersinger Spring 99 * In the succinct comentary to the full score, there is a useful guidance over rhythmic conventions and a heartening open-mindedness about the validity of a wide variety of interpretations . . . The printing and layout are examplary, and the vocal score is very competitive in price. The full score is exceptional value and is extremely practical. * Martin Neary, Early Music Review Dec 98 * Such simple practical aids will save much rehearsal time: one hopes that other publishers of choral works will follow suit . . . The text is an eminently practical one, not least in the keyboard reduction which lies easily under the fingers. Rapid semiquaver runs in thirds and sixths are avoided wherever possible, yet the essentials of the orchestral texture are always present in an effective transcription for piano or organ which can be used both for rehearsals and for performances without orchestra. * Choir &amp; Organ Jan 99 * The stated purpose of the edition is to present a score in modern notation that represents what Handel wrote, doing so with the minimum of editorial interference in order to allow performers to make thier own decisions about how to interpret it . . . The result of this editorial restraint is a refreshingly uncluttererd score which can be used by experts and non-specialists alike . . . The music is clearly drawn and printed on good quality paper with no perceptible show-through. Where movements occupy more than a single page the title and number is shown in small print on each page, and the initial page number for each item in the vocal score is printed in the full score for ease of cross-referencing. * Choir &amp; Organ Jan 99 * The players loved the parts - clear and clean, and I loved the edition; almost everyone in the Hall (the sell-out audience of 1200+ and all the performers) had a marvellous evening . . . I know Clifford and like his work very much indeed - please convey my congratulations to him and the setters and printers, and yourselves, of course, as publishers, for doing everyone such a great favour in producing this wonderful new edition - it's the one for me!! * Colin Touchin, Director of Music, University of Warwick * Bartlett's line on performance practice is sensible and non-didactic . . . The result is an edition that's clean and unfussy, refreshingly uncluttered by superfluous grace-notes or odd-looking demi-semiquaver ornaments . . .

The presentation is designed primarily for computer science students rather than for (say) mathematicians. No knowledge of the theory of computation is required, but it would help to have some acquaintance with high level programming languages. The selection of material is based on an undergraduate semantics course taught at Edinburgh University for the last few years. Enough descriptive techniques are covered to handle all of ALGOL 50, PASCAL and other similar languages. Denotational semantics combines a powerful and lucid descriptive notation (due mainly to Strachey) with an elegant and rigorous theory (due to Scott). This book provides an introduction to the descriptive techniques without going into the background mathematics at all. In some ways this is very unsatisfactory; reliable reasoning about semantics (e. g. correctness proofs) cannot be done without knowing the underlying model and so learning semantic notation without its model theory could be argued to be pointless. My own feeling is that there is plenty to be gained from acquiring a purely intuitive understanding of semantic concepts together with manipulative competence in the notation. For these equip one with a powerful conceptua1 framework-a framework enabling one to visualize languages and constructs in an elegant and machine-independent way. Perhaps a good analogy is with calculus: for many practical purposes (e. g. engineering calculations) an intuitive understanding of how to differentiate and integrate is all that is needed.</p><p></p><h2>Dal�/Duchamp</h2><p><p><strong>Eroticism, science and humor collide in the work of these two close friends</strong></p><p><i>Dal�/Duchamp</i> takes a detailed look at the little-explored relationship between two of the 20th century&#x2019;s most famous artists. The two might seem like polar opposites at first glance&#x2015;Marcel Duchamp (1887&#x2013;1968), the father of conceptual art who rejected painting in 1918, appears to have little in common with the showmanlike Salvador Dal� (1904&#x2013;89), the exceptional Surrealist painter of fantastical landscapes. But the two men were united by a unique combination of humor and skepticism that led both to challenge conventional views of art and life in their own respective ways. </p><p>Beyond their shared thematic concerns, the artists knew and respected each other. After meeting in the 1930s through mutual contacts within the Surrealist group, Duchamp and Dal� maintained a firm friendship over the following decades, spending time together in Paris, New York and Catalonia, where Duchamp purchased a summer house in Cadaqu�s, close to Dal�&#x2019;s home in Port Lligat.</p><p>Throughout this volume, expert contributors explore themes common to both artists, chief among them eroticism and identity, and both men&#x2019;s engagement with science, optics, religion and myth. Each section of the book is sumptuously illustrated with key pieces from both artists&#x2019; bodies of work and features previously unpublished photographs, letters and ephemera that testify to the enduring warmth of their friendship. <i>Dal�/Duchamp</i> offers a fresh understanding of the work of two seminal artists of the 20th century.</p></p><p>...revealing their shared impish humour, and urge to upset the applecart of the art world.

The subjects of this study are <i>hijras</i> or the "third sex" of India&#x2014;individuals who occupy a unique, liminal space between male and female, sacred and profane.<br> <br> <i>Hijras</i> are men who sacrifice their genitalia to a goddess in return for the power to confer fertility on newlyweds and newborn children, a ritual role they are respected for, at the same time as they are stigmatized for their ambiguous sexuality. By focusing on the <i>hijra</i> community, Gayatri Reddy sheds new light on Indian society and the intricate negotiations of identity across various domains of everyday life. Further, by reframing <i>hijra</i> identity through the local economy of respect, this ethnography highlights the complex relationships among local and global, sexual and moral, economies.<br> <br> This book will be regarded as the definitive work on <i>hijras</i>, one that will be of enormous interest to anthropologists, students of South Asian culture, and specialists in the study of gender and sexuality.</p></p><p><b>Gayatri Reddy</b> is assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois at Chicago."This book is an important and significant one.

Dr. Richard Jolly, Acting Executive Director UNICEF Breastfeeding is a beautiful process. It involves the participation of both mother and child and cannot be duplicated by a glass bottle and rubber nipple. So why does the United States have the lowest breastfeeding rate in the industrialized world? In Milk, Money and Madness, Baumslag and Michels examine the issue of breastfeeding, clearly drawing a line between fact and fiction. Among the main points addressed are: o How U.S. taxpayers unwittingly support and encourage bottle-feeding by spending over $500 million each year to provide 37% of the infants in the U.S. with free formula. o How a product created to help sick children and foundlings was transformed into a powerful international industry with revenues of $22 million a day. o How an intimate and self-affirming life experience that is responsible for the survival of our species has been reduced to just one feeding option. Milk, Money, and Madness provides parents and health professionals with the information they need to fully appreciate and advise about this critical life choice. By reviewing the history, culture, biology, and politics of breastfeeding, Milk, Money, and Madness gives the reader a more complete understanding of the uniqueness of breastfeeding. The crucial decision between breastfeeding and formula feeding is increasingly complicated by misinformation and unfounded theories which cloud the actual facts. By all accounts, breastmilk is the most amazing life-sustaining fluid known to humanity. Many women who breastfeed characterize it as perhaps the most fulfilling life experience they will ever know. Scientific research supports the fact that breastfed babies are healthier, have lower infant mortality rates and fewer chronic illnesses throughout their lives than formula-fed babies. Similarly, women who breastfeed are significantly less likely to contract serious illnesses such as breast cancer. Alarmingly few people are aware of the unique benefits of breastfeeding and do not understand the dangers and risks of feeding an infant formula. In fact, the United States has the lowest breastfeeding rate in the industrialized world. Why has our society defied common sense and scientific data when breastfeeding has so many biological, emotional, environmental, and even financial advantages over laboratory blends? Milk, Money, and Madness is a thought-provoking book that offers honest answers and straight facts about breastfeeding. This book is designed to provide women, men, health workers, doctors, nurses, and midwives with the knowledge they need to advise or decide about the most suitable means of nourishment for infants. Baumslag and Michels consider the effects of 50 years of clever marketing and advertising which have transformed this society into one where bottle feeding is the norm and infant formula is considered to be essential to women&#39;s liberation and the forming of a paternal-infant bond. They also examine attitudes toward breastfeeding in cultures all around the world as compared to the antipathy toward breastfeeding that pervades the United States. Milk, Money, and Madness cuts through the myths and paranoia to offer an enlightening, culturally significant look at one of the most fundamentally beautiful functions of the human experience.</p><p>&#34;The authors have provided an easy-to-read, up-to-date source for understanding breastfeeding from a wide variety of perspectives--historical, medical, economic, and political. More significantly, they make this information accessible by addressing commonly-asked questions: Is the milk good enough? Isn&#39;t formula just a Third World issue? Is mother&#39;s milk always safe? How should formula be sold?&#34;-Penny Van Esterik Associate Professor of Anthropology, York University, Toronto<b>Provides an understanding why breastfeeding is an issue.</b><br>It is an irony that this book needed to be written. It wasn't that long ago that breastfeeding was as much a part of the maternal experience as pregnancy. Now, many American mothers think twice about it ... and decide not to bother. There are many wonderful books instructing women "how" to brestfeed, but information on "why" to is scarce. This books provides the big picture about breastfeeding, explaining its history, culture, biology and politics. It is an important book to help women understand the miracle substance they are capable of producing and to respect the magnificence of their bodies.</p><h2>Three-Dimensional Geometry and Topology, Vol. 1</h2><p><p>This book develops some of the extraordinary richness, beauty, and power of geometry in two and three dimensions, and the strong connection of geometry with topology. Hyperbolic geometry is the star. A strong effort has been made to convey not just denatured formal reasoning (definitions, theorems, and proofs), but a living feeling for the subject. There are many figures, examples, and exercises of varying difficulty.</p><br><p> This book was the origin of a grand scheme developed by Thurston that is now coming to fruition. In the 1920s and 1930s the mathematics of two-dimensional spaces was formalized. It was Thurston's goal to do the same for three-dimensional spaces. To do this, he had to establish the strong connection of geometry to topology--the study of qualitative questions about geometrical structures. The author created a new set of concepts, and the expression "Thurston-type geometry" has become a commonplace.</p><br><br><p> <i>Three-Dimensional Geometry and Topology</i> had its origins in the form of notes for a graduate course the author taught at Princeton University between 1978 and 1980. Thurston shared his notes, duplicating and sending them to whoever requested them. Eventually, the mailing list grew to more than one thousand names. The book is the culmination of two decades of research and has become the most important and influential text in the field. Its content also provided the methods needed to solve one of mathematics' oldest unsolved problems--the Poincar� Conjecture.</p><br><p> In 2005 Thurston won the first AMS Book Prize, for <i>Three-dimensional Geometry and Topology</i>. The prize recognizes an outstanding research book that makes a seminal contribution to the research literature. Thurston received the Fields Medal, the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize, in 1982 for the depth and originality of his contributions to mathematics. In 1979 he was awarded the Alan T. Waterman Award, which recognizes an outstanding young researcher in any field of science or engineering supported by the National Science Foundation.</p></p><p>This book develops some of the extraordinary richness, beauty, and power of geometry in two and three dimensions, and the strong connection of geometry with topology.

She scoffed in 1910. 'I'll tell you what the suffragettes deserve: the whip and the harem'. COLETTE is an intriguing and flamboyant figure. Born in Burgundy in 1873 she moved to Paris at the age of twenty with her husband the writer and critic Henry Gauthiers-Viller (Willy). Forcing Colette to write, Willy published her novels in his name and the Claudine series became an instant success. She escaped her exploitative first husband to live by her pen and work in music-halls as a dancer. Colette had a lesbian love affair with a niece of Napoleon's, she married three times, had a baby at 40 and at 47, preferring 'passion to goodness', she seduced her teenage stepson. In the meantime she wrote stunning novels that were admired by Proust and Gide -- <i>Gigi, Sido, Cheri,</i> and <i>Break of Day</i>. Colette lived to be over 80.

The purpose of the book, as of the lectures, is to survey some of the main themes in the modern theory of stochastic processes. In my previous book Probability: ! survey of the mathe� matical theory I gave a short overview of &#34;classical&#34; proba� bility mathematics, concentrating especially on sums of inde� pendent random variables. I did not discuss specific appli� cations of the theory; I did strive for a spirit friendly to application by coming to grips as fast as I could with the major problems and techniques and by avoiding too high levels of abstraction and completeness. At the same time, I tried to make the proofs both rigorous and motivated and to show how certain results have evolved rather than just presenting them in polished final form. The same remarks apply to this book, at least as a statement of intentions, and it can serve as a sequel to the earlier one continuing the story in the same style and spirit. The contents of the present book fall roughly into two parts. The first deals mostly with stationary processes, which provide the mathematics for describing phenomena in a steady state overall but subject to random fluctuations. Chapter 4 is the heart of this part.</p><p></p><h2>Writing the Breakout Novel: Insider Advice for Taking Your Fiction to the Next Level</h2><p>Describes the elements that all &#34;breakout novels&#34; share and details writing techniques to make a book stand out and succeed.</p><p>Donald Maass is the author of 17 novels. He now works as a literary agent, representing dozens of novelists in the SF, fantasy, crime, mystery, romance and thriller categories. He speaks at writer&#39;s conferences throughout the country and lives in New York City.In today's world, an author who doesn't produce a breakout novel risks getting lost in the midlist of the publishing world. Maass, the author of 17 novels who now works as a literary agent representing such distinguished writers as Anne Perry and James Patterson, knows firsthand what makes a novel rise above its category in the already saturated book market. Using his own clients as case studies, Maass defines the most crucial elements of a breakout novel a powerful sense of time and place, larger-than-life characters, a high degree of tension, good subplots, and universal themes and shows the reader how to use these elements efficiently to write a novel that will generate interest and have the potential to hit the best sellers lists.

For Lucy Ashton and Edgar Ravenswood, acts of heroism are thwarted and love is doomed by social, political and historical division. This edition restores the action to the years of uncertainty and political flux before the Union of Scotland and England in 1707, rather than after, as Scott's later revision had placed it.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.-- Based on the acclaimed Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels<br>-- The first authoritative edition drawn from Scott's original texts<br>-- With a special introduction for the Penguin Classics edition<p>Sir William Ashton, a devious lawyer, has deprived Lord Ravenswood of his title, his estate and subsequently of his life by means of legal and financial trickery. Edgar, Ravenswood's only son, has inherited his father's desire for vengeance. When he meets his adversary by chance, however, he not only saves Ashton's life, but falls in love with his daughter Lucy. The couple wish to marry, but will the ancient prophecy of Ravenswood stand in their way? With Scott's characteristic humour and wisdom, The Bride of Lammermoor brings to vivid life a historical incident from Scotland's turbulent past.</p></p><h2>Philosophy Of Mind</h2><p>The philosophy of mind has always been a staple of the philosophy curriculum. But it has never held a more important place than it does today, with both traditional problems and new topics often sparked by the implications of modern psychology, cognitive science, and computer science.In this concise but comprehensive survey, Jaegwon Kim explores, maps, and interprets this difficult terrain. Designed as a textbook for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, <i>Philosophy of Mind</i> succeeds brilliantly on these terms. But it also manages to offer riches to experienced philosophers while remaining accessible to readers new to philosophy.Focusing on the traditional mind/body problem, Kim canvasses the traditional attempts to explain the mind as soul, as certain forms of behavior, as brain, or as a type of computer as well as more recent complex attempts to meet objections raised by these accounts. The author also includes extensive coverage of the issues surrounding content and consciousness.Throughout, Kim allows readers to come to their own terms with these views. At the same time, the author's own emerging views are on display and serve to advance the discussion. Readers of Kim's previous work will especially welcome this aspect of the text.Comprehensive, clear, and fair, <i>Philosophy of Mind</i> is a model of philosophical exposition. It is a major contribution to the study and teaching of the philosophy of mind.</p><p><b>Jaegwon Kim</b> is William Perry Faunce Professor of Philosophy at Brown University. He is the author of <i>Supervenience and Mind</i> (1993) and of many important papers on the philosophy of mind, metaphysics, epistemology, and the philosophy of science.Kim's book is the best general survey of metaphysics of mind. It brims with arresting arguments and lucid points of exposition. Kim's own philosophical judgment is not suppressed, but he gives sympathetic accounts of opposing views. Perhaps no other text accessible to undergraduates is so often consulted by professional philosophers. Most chapters have been augmented in this third edition, but its most distinctive feature is its expanded discussion of consciousness.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>Bernard W. Kobes, Arizona State University</b><br><br>Praise for Previous Editions:<br><br> Like the highly acclaimed earlier edition, this book provides an extremely useful, state-of-the-art introduction to the philosophy of mind.

As the quail was being carried away by the hawk, it lamented, &#x201c;How unfortunate I am, what little merit I possess to have wandered out of my natural habitat into a foreign domain. If I had wandered within my native domain today, within my own ancestral, natural habitat, this hawk would certainly not have been a match for me in battle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is your native domain, quail? What is your own ancestral, natural habitat?&#x201d; asked the hawk.<br><br>The quail answered, &#x201c;That clod of earth freshly tilled with a plow.&#x201d;<br><br>Then the hawk, not boasting about its own strength, not mentioning its own strength, released the quail, saying, &#x201c;Go, quail; but having gone there, you cannot escape me.&#x201d;<br><br>Then the quail, having gone to the clod of earth freshly tilled with a plow, climbed onto the large clod of earth and, standing there, said to the hawk, &#x201c;Come get me now, hawk, come get me now!&#x201d;<br><br>Now the hawk, not boasting about its own strength, not mentioning its own strength, folded up its wings and suddenly swooped down on the quail. When the quail fully realized that the hawk was coming, it got inside that clod of earth. And the hawk, striking against it, suffered a blow to its chest.<br><br>So it is when someone wanders out of his or her natural habitat into a foreign domain. Therefore, do not wander out of your natural habitat into a foreign domain. Death will gain access [1.1]* to the person who has wandered out of his or her natural habitat into a foreign domain, death will gain a footing.<br><br>Now, what is for you a foreign domain, outside of your natural habitat? It is the fivefold realm of sensual pleasure [1.2]. Which five? Forms perceptible to the eye, which are pleasing, desirable, charming, agreeable, arousing desire, and enticing; sounds perceptible to the ear, which are pleasing, desirable, charming, agreeable, arousing desire, and enticing; scents perceptible to the nose, which are pleasing, desirable, charming, agreeable, arousing desire, and enticing; tastes perceptible to the tongue, which are pleasing, desirable, charming, agreeable, arousing desire, and enticing; tactile objects perceptible to the body, which are pleasing, desirable, charming, agreeable, arousing desire, and enticing. This is for you a foreign domain, outside of your natural habitat. Death will not gain access to the person who lives within his or her native domain; within his or her own ancestral, natural habitat, death will not gain a footing. Now, what is your native domain, your own ancestral, natural habitat? It is the foundation of present-moment awareness [1.3] in four areas [1.4]. What are the four areas? Now, being ardent, fully aware, and mindful, and having put down longing and discontentment toward the world, live observing the body in and as the body, live observing feelings in and as feelings, live observing mind in and as mind, and live observing mental qualities and phenomena in and as mental qualities and phenomena.<br><br>ji<br><br>This is your native domain, your own ancestral, natural habitat.<br><br>* Numbers refer to notes in the Guide.</p><h2>Public Health Nursing: Practicing Population-Based Care: Practicing Population-Based Care</h2><p>Public Health Nursing: Practicing Population-Based Care, Third Edition is a comprehensive resource for students and faculty interested in public health nursing and education.

The Demon Princes are a race of beings who disguise themselves as humans and delight in power and destruction. however, to Kirth they are merely murderers who killed his family and destroyed his home planet--and who deserves to die for those misdeeds. Three have already fallen in Kirth's hands, but there are two more names on his list, two more Princes who will live only long enough to regret their evil ways.<br></p><p>Jack Vance excels at writing a series of shorter works that together comprise a grand, interstellar adventure. Such is the <i>The Demon Princes,</i> a series of five tales that chronicle Kirth Gersen's quest for vengeance against the five demon princes. The princes led the Mount Pleasant Massacre, a raid that destroyed Gersen's family and his world. But now Kirth is on their trail, and no matter how many galaxies there are to search, he will find them one by one and exact his revenge. This first volume collects three of the five Demon Prince stories, while the second volume will carry the remaining two.<p><b>Jack Vance</b>, born John Holbrook Vance in 1916, was one of the greatest masters of fantasy and science fiction.

He worked in Germany for years as chief correspondent for the London Times and has written several works of the Anglo-German naval history. He currently resides in Eel Pie Island, Twickenham, England.The first workable prototype?the Fenian Ram?of an underwater warship was designed by Irishman John Holland in 1882. By the turn of the century, the U.S., Britain and especially Germany began to equip their navies with submarines. The submarine became infamous in 1915, when a German U-20 sank the luxury liner Lusitania off the Irish coast?with a tremendous loss of life?an attack that eventually brought the U.S. into WWI. The submarine also necessitated new means to subvert it: convoys, rudimentary sonar, depth charges and ships outfitted with seaplanes. Van der Vat's coverage of the WWII period focuses on innovative German Admiral Donitz's U-boat "wolf packs"; the Allies relying on convoys; and the successes of the U.S. and Japanese in submarine warfare against each other. The post-WWII era concentrates on Admiral Hyman Rickover and the first nuclear-powered sub, the U.S.S. Nautilus, and its trip to the North Pole. The cold war period looks at the technological advances made by Soviet and U.S. subs that became capable of firing ICBMs from any ocean. Van der Vat (The Grand Scuttle) has written a comprehensive volume that will delight submarine buffs.

Fortunately, you can succeed at making change. In <i> <b>Fearless Change,</b> </i> Mary Lynn Manns and Linda Rising illuminate 48 proven techniques, or patterns, for implementing change in organizations or teams of all sizes, and show you exactly how to use them successfully. </p> <p>Find out how to</p><ul> <li>Understand the forces in your organization that drive and retard change</li> <li>Plant the seeds of change</li> <li>Drive participation and buy-in, from start to finish</li> <li>Choose an "official skeptic" to sharpen your thinking</li> <li>Make your changes appear less threatening</li> <li>Find the right timing and the best teaching moments</li> <li>Sustain your momentum</li> <li>Overcome adversity and celebrate success</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Inspired by the "pattern languages" that are transforming fields from software to architecture, the authors illuminate patterns for every stage of the change process: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. These flexible patterns draw on the experiences of hundreds of leaders.

For the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order, this lukewarmness arising partly from fear of their adversaries...and partly from the incredulity of mankind, who do not truly believe in anything new until they have had actual experience of it. <br><b>&#x2014;Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince</b></p><p>You miss one hundred percent of the shots you never take.<br> <b>&#x2014;Wayne Gretzky, Hall of Fame hockey player</b></p><p>Since you picked up this book, we assume that you've tried to introduce something new into your organization. Maybe you were successful or maybe you were not completely happy with the result. Change is hard. Wouldn't it be wonderful if all the people, just like you, those "powerless leaders," who have had some success in their attempts to introduce a new idea, could sit down with you and share their secrets? This book will provide the next best thing. We've gathered strategies from those successful people so you can take advantage of their experience.</p><p>We've been working on introducing new ideas into the workplace for some time. Mary Lynn Manns is a professor at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, whose recent doctoral work concerned this topic. Linda Rising is an independent consultant who has experience introducing new ideas both in academia and industry. Together with all the others who have shared their experiences with us, we have many years of documented successes. </p><p>Each technique or strategy we have collected is written as a <i>pattern</i>&#x2014;a form of knowledge management for capturing a recurring, successful practice. The patterns in this book are the result of years of documenting our observations, hearing from people who have introduced new ideas, reading a variety of views on the topics of change and influence, studying how change agents throughout history have tackled the problems they faced, and sharing our work for comments and feedback. This book, the final product, does not simply reflect our ideas but includes those of many different people in many different organizations throughout the world. Expert change leaders are likely to say "I do that!" when they read many of these techniques. We will take this comment as a tribute to our work because our goal was to identify tried and true practices, not just a collection of good ideas that may or may not work.</p><p>The idea of documenting patterns for successful solutions to recurring problems was introduced by a building architect named Christopher Alexander. Even though we are not architects, a number of us in the software development community have adopted Alexander's approach as a way to capture known solutions for software architecture, software design, testing, customer interaction, and other aspects of software development. The introduction of new ideas is, of course, not limited to the software area, but it's where we both began to see a new source for important and useful patterns.</p><p>We intend this book for business practitioners rather than academic scholars, so we have chosen not to cite sources inside the text. However, we are always happy to answer any questions about the specific sources and the patterns. This work is built on research, including that of Robert Cialdini, Malcolm Gladwell, Geoffrey Moore, E.M. Rogers, Peter Senge, and many others. We have included a complete list of citations in the References section, if you would like to read further.</p><p>The patterns are listed alphabetically, with a brief summary, on the inside front and back covers of the book. Pattern names include a page reference where the complete pattern may be found, for example, Fear Less(?). As we describe pattern uses and experience reports, you will see a pattern reference and you can turn to the appropriate page and read more about the pattern. This book can thus become a reference after you have read the initial chapters. When looking for the solution to a particular problem, you can simply skim the summaries and refer to the complete pattern description for a more detailed explanation.</p><p>This pattern collection has evolved over several years thanks to many pattern originators and countless others who have provided comments, pattern uses, and other feedback. Even though the book has now been published, we continue to care for these patterns and would like to hear from all of you, our readers.

Does the predominantly masculine symbolism of the Biblical writings exclude women or overlook the riches of their spiritual life? If Christ is &#34;the second Adam&#34; and the one on whom all Christian life must be patterned, then what about Eve? This book from a leading scholar of religious language and feminism opens up the Bible&#39;s imagery for sex, gender, and kinship and does so by discussing its place in the central teachings of Christian theology: the doctrine of God and spirituality, Imago Dei and anthropology, Creation, Christology and the Cross, the Trinity, and eschatology.</p><p><br>Janet Martin Soskice is Reader in Philosophical Theology, University of Cambridge.<br>Soskice throws off many provocative insights [such as] in a splendid chapter on friendship [in which] she traces the notion from Aristotle through to CS Lewis. * Fergus Kerr, The Tablet * Here is a woman powerfully challenging the patriarchal tradition of her Church and doing it ... by careful scholarly exploration of its faith and spirituality... * Peter Cornwell, Times Literary Supplement * ...[An] important collection of essays... * Paul Richardson Church of England Newspaper * Janet Martin Soskice's new book brings together material published since 1991 together with a substantial new piece and a short coda to the whole book... Her realism always draws the reader away from the flights of abstract fancy to the facts of women's lives as a starting point for theology. * Gerald Hegarty, Expository Times * [A] wonderful book... this is an enlightening piece of erudite research. It is a worthy book for the scholar and the general public interested in the search for appropriate metaphors that can link us into the reality of God. * Thomas G. Grenham, Milltown Studies * [A] stimulating book of essays * Anne Thurston, Doctrine &amp; Life * When I began to read The Kindness of God, I could scarcely put it down... The book maintains a marvelous tone. Its manner is kind. It belabors nothing... The tone constructs both the author and the readeras people with interests, who care, who seek to understand something without heat. Everywhere there prevails a light touch. A light touch is such a rare thing... Soskice's scholarly voice is nearly unique. She shares with Thomas Aquinas the virtue of arguing with ideas, while leaving her opponents unnamed... The Kindness of God treats the... fraught topic of God and gender with a range, delight, and finesse that no one else, as far as I can think, could manage. * Eugene F. Rogers Jr., Modern Theology *</p><h2>The Guns of Victory: A Soldier&#39;s Eve View, Belgium, Holland, and Germany, 1944-45</h2><p>For the Canadian Soldiers who lived through the momentous battle for Normandy in the summer of 1944, it was inconceivable that the conflict in Europe could continue for another eight long months. The war was won, they thought, and to win it they had been pushed to what seemed like the limits of endurance. But ahead lay not only an enemy with no thoughts of surrender, but also appalling battle conditions reminiscent of the legendary miseries of Passchendaele. <br><br>This much-anticipated sequel to <i>The Guns of Normany</i> picks up where its critically acclaimed predecessor leaves off, and it continues in the same absorbing, startlingly vivid style. After the battle for Normandy, Blackburn&#x2019;s 4th Field Regiment, with the rest of 1st Canadian Army, is called upon to pursue the enemy through the flooded Low Country, clearing the Scheldt estuary &#x2013; a task equal to that of D-Day &#x2013; and opening the port of Antwerp to allow for the huge influx of supplies necessary to press on against the German forces, now fighting with mounting desperation and ferocity. <br><br>After enduring the worst winter in local memory, and spending yet another Christmas far from home, in the spring of 1945 the Canadians are thrust into the crucial Battle of the Rhineland, which will eventually allow Allied forces to plunge into the heart of the Reich.<br><br>When victory comes, it is with no sense of triumph over a vanquished foe, but with the profoundest relief that this most terrible conflict in history is finally over.<br><br>Told with Blackburn&#x2019;s now trademark sense of drama and eye for detail, this story of the desperate struggle for Europe becomes as large as life. It should fully establish Blackburn as the author of an acknowledged classic on the Second World War.</p><p>&#x201c;It is exciting when the second volume of a great memoir continues and deepens the experiences of the first one.

The acclaimed "Homer of the Civil War," has won a huge, devoted following with his extraordinary battlefield tours and eloquent soliloquies about the heroes, scoundrels, and little-known moments of a conflict that still fascinates America.

As he guides readers from the first shots at Fort Sumter to Gettysburg's bloody fields to the dignified surrender at Appomattox, his engagingly plainspoken but expert account demonstrates why he stands beside Shelby Foote, James McPherson, and Ken Burns in the front rank of modern chroniclers of the Civil War, as the Pulitzer Prize-winning McPherson himself points out in his admiring introduction. <br><br>A must for every one of America's countless Civil War and history buffs alike, this major work will stand as an important reference and enduring legacy of a great historian for generations to come.</p><p>Edwin C.

Diaries, letters, and intimate writings reveal a complicated, untold story.</b><br><br> The news of Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination on April 15, 1865, just days after Confederate surrender, astounded the war-weary nation. Massive crowds turned out for services and ceremonies. Countless expressions of grief and dismay were printed in newspapers and preached in sermons. Public responses to the assassination have been well chronicled, but this book is the first to delve into the personal and intimate responses of everyday people&#x2014;northerners and southerners, soldiers and civilians, black people and white, men and women, rich and poor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Through deep and thoughtful exploration of diaries, letters, and other personal writings penned during the spring and summer of 1865, Martha Hodes, one of our finest historians, captures the full range of reactions to the president&#x2019;s death&#x2014;far more diverse than public expressions would suggest. She tells a story of shock, glee, sorrow, anger, blame, and fear. &#x201c;&#x2019;Tis the saddest day in our history,&#x201d; wrote a mournful man. It was &#x201c;an electric shock to my soul,&#x201d; wrote a woman who had escaped from slavery. &#x201c;Glorious News!&#x201d; a Lincoln enemy exulted. &#x201c;Old Lincoln is dead, and I will kill the goddamned Negroes now,&#x201d; an angry white southerner ranted. For the black soldiers of the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts, it was all &#x201c;too overwhelming, too lamentable, too distressing&#x201d; to absorb.<br> &nbsp;<br> There are many surprises in the story Hodes tells, not least the way in which even those utterly devastated by Lincoln&#x2019;s demise easily interrupted their mourning rituals to attend to the most mundane aspects of everyday life. There is also the unexpected and unabated virulence of Lincoln&#x2019;s northern critics, and the way Confederates simultaneously celebrated Lincoln&#x2019;s death and instantly&#x2014;on the very day he died&#x2014;cast him as a fallen friend to the defeated white South.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hodes brings to life a key moment of national uncertainty and confusion, when competing visions of America&#x2019;s future proved irreconcilable and hopes for racial justice in the aftermath of the Civil War slipped from the nation&#x2019;s grasp. Hodes masterfully brings the tragedy of Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination alive in human terms&#x2014;terms that continue to stagger and rivet us one hundred and fifty years after the event they so strikingly describe.</p><p>What led you to write a book about personal responses to Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination? <br> <br> I was in New York City on September 11, 2001, and I remember the moment of Kennedy's assassination from my childhood. As a historian of the Civil War era, and as someone who lived through those two modern-day transformative events, I wanted to know not only what happened in 1865 when people heard the news of Lincoln&#x2019;s death but also what those responses meant. <br> &nbsp; <br> Did anything surprise you during your research? <br> <br> Almost everything. Not only did I find a much wider array of emotions and stories than I'd imagined, I also found that even those utterly devastated by the assassination easily interrupted their mourning to attend to the most mundane aspects of everyday life. I also found myself surprised by the unabated virulence of Lincoln's northern critics and the way Confederates simultaneously celebrated Lincoln's death and instantly&#x2014;on the very day he died&#x2014;cast him as a fallen friend to the white South. <br> &nbsp; <br> Do personal responses to Lincoln's assassination tell a larger story about American history? <br> <br> Very much so. The assassination provoked personal responses that were deeply intertwined with different and irreconcilable visions of the postwar and post-emancipation nation. Black freedom, the fate of former Confederates, and the future of the nation were at stake for all Americans, black and white, North and South, whether they grieved or rejoiced when they heard the news. <br> <br> Praise for <i>Mourning Lincoln</i> <br> <br> &#x201c;There are many books on the Lincoln assassination and the public response to it.&nbsp; But Martha Hodes&#x2019;s work is the first to focus in great detail on the responses of ordinary individuals, Northern and Southern, white and black, soldiers and civilians, women and men, in their diaries and personal correspondence, and to blend such response into the larger story of public events.&nbsp; The amount of research is simply staggering.&nbsp; This is a highly original, lucidly written, book.&#x201d;&#x2014;James M. McPherson, author of <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i> <br> &nbsp; &#x201c;Beautiful and terrible, Hodes's marvelously written story of the assassination fills the mind, heart and soul.&nbsp; People never forgot the event; this book is a page-turner that makes it all unforgettable again as it also explains how one shocking death illuminated so many others.&#x201d;&#x2014;David W.

It tells the story of a woman named Valency and her discovery of a new world of love and happiness. Valency escapes the clutches of her overbearing family and finds solace in her new friendships and new surroundings. This early work by Lucy Maud Montgomery was originally published in 1926 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. Lucy Maud Montgomery was born on 30th November 1874, New London, in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. Her mother, Clara Woolner (Macneil), died before Lucy reached the age of two and so she was raised by her maternal grandparents in a family of wealthy Scottish immigrants. In 1908 Montgomery produced her first full-length novel, titled &#39;Anne of Green Gables&#39;. It was an instant success, and following it up with several sequels, Montgomery became a regular on the best-seller list and an international household name. Montgomery died in Toronto on 24th April 1942.</p><p>At twenty-nine Valancy had never been in love, and it seemed romance had passed her by. Living with her overbearing mother and meddlesome aunt, she found her only consolations in the &#34;forbidden&#34; books of John Foster and her daydreams of the Blue Castle. Then a letter arrived from Dr. Trent -- and Valancy decided to throw caution to the winds. For the first time in her life Valancy did and said exactly what she wanted. Soon she discovered a surprising new world, full of love and adventures far beyond her most secret dreams.Lucy Maud Montgomery CBE, (always called "Maud" by family and friends) and publicly known as L. M. Montgomery, (November 30, 1874&#x2013;April 24, 1942) was a Canadian author, best known for a series of novels beginning with Anne of Green Gables, published in 1908. Once published, Anne of Green Gables was an immediate success. The central character, Anne, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. The novels became the basis for the highly acclaimed 1985 CBC television miniseries, Anne of Green Gables and several other television movies and programs, including Road to Avonlea, which ran in Canada and the U.S. from 1990-1996.</p><h2>Structural Steel Design</h2><p>The material is presented in a clear, reader-friendly style.

Physical complaints--allergies, fever, sore throat, inflammation, cysts, backache, migraines, sinus problems, sciatica, dizzy spells, and even cancer--are all signs of deep tensions inside of us are seeking expression. This is why, given the same genetic foundation, one individual develops a specific illness while another remains in good health. <br><br>Drawing on 20 years of experience and several thousand individual consultations with patients, Michel Odoul shows the &#x201c;proof&#x201d; of this lies in the clear correspondences between emotional and mental tensions and specific ailments. The author reveals how every illness or trauma is a signal of incredible precision: The part of the body affected pinpoints what your inner being is trying to tell you and what you need to work through emotionally. Providing a reference grid of body-mind connections, he explains, for example, how skin conditions reflect difficulties with aggression from the outside world and knee problems indicate inflexibility or tension in relationships. He shows not only how each side of the body has specific meanings and connections to emotions, relationships, and family but also how the upper and lower halves of the body have specific connections--together forming four quadrants with unique Yin-Yang balances, where Yin represents emotional issues and Yang represents action/inaction. He also explores the role of the meridians of Chinese medicine in distributing emotional and mental energy throughout the body. <br><br>Offering keys to decipher what the body is trying to tell us, the author shows that we can learn to see physical ailments not as something caused by chance or fate but as a message from our heart and soul. By releasing the energies and patterns they point to, we can return to a state of health and forward movement on our path through life.</p><p>Michel Odoul is a shiatsu and psychoenergetic medicine practitioner as well as the founder of the French Institute of Shiatsu and Applied Physical Psychology. He has appeared at numerous health conferences through the world, including the 2013 international meeting of Acupuncturists without Borders. He lives in Paris.<b>Chapter 4 <br><br>The Role of Each Part of the Body <br>A Symbolic Message System</b> <br><br>How is the body put together? And what is the role of each of the parts and organs that compose it and support its existence and functioning?<br><br>First of all, it is constructed around a frame, a solid, hard structure: the skeleton. This skeleton, made of bones, is rigid but jointed in order to support all bodily movement. It is itself structured around a basic axis that is the spinal column. Here we have our &#x201c;magic trunk&#x201d; from which spread out all the &#x201c;branches&#x201d; of our body. <br><br>Inside this load-bearing structure, we have the various organs, which are placed perfectly so that their functions operate under the best possible conditions. The whole is set in motion by a 4 very extensive system of motors (muscles) and cables (tendons, ligaments) and is protected with an envelope that completely encloses it (the skin). <br><br>We are now going to take each part of our body and study it in detail. This is how we will find, for each part, the secret codes that will allow us to decipher its messages. <br><br>The Lower Limbs The lower limbs are composed of two parts, the upper leg (thigh and femur) and the lower leg (calf, tibia, and fibula), and three important axes which are their main joints. They end in a masterful piece--the foot. <br><br>The joints that connect and articulate the foot, the lower leg, the upper leg, and the torso are the hip, the knee, and the ankle. What is the primary physiological role of our legs? They are what allow us to move about, to go forward or back, from one place to another, and, of course, toward others. Therefore, they are our mobility agents that put us into relationship with the world and with other people. The &#x201c;societal&#x201d; symbolism of the leg is very strong. It&#x2019;s the leg that makes possible gatherings, meetings, contacts, and movement forward. Our legs then are our agents of relationship. <br><br><b>Lower Limb Issues</b> <br><br>In a very general sense, when we have tension or pain in the legs, it means that we have tension in our relationships with the world or with someone. We are having difficulty moving forward or backward in the relational space of the moment. The more precisely we can pinpoint the location within the leg, the more we will be able to refine the type of tension we are experiencing and the more likely we will understand it. <br><br><b>The Hip</b> <br><br>The hip corresponds to the primary, basic, &#x201c;mother&#x201d; joint of the lower limbs. It is from the hip that all potential movement of these limbs begins. It also represents the basic axis of our world of relationships. We term it the &#x201c;doorway of the relational unconscious&#x201d; (see fig. 4.2), the point through which the elements of our unconscious emerge toward the conscious. Our deepest plans, our beliefs about relating to others and to the world, and the way in which we experience our relationships are somatically represented by the hip. Any disturbance--conscious or not--in these areas will have repercussions at the site of one of our hips. <br><br><b>Hip Issues</b> <br><br>Problems with the hip--pain, tension, blockages, arthroses--show us that we are moving through a situation where the basis of our deepest beliefs is being brought into question. When the hip lets go it means that our deep inner supports, our most deeply rooted beliefs connecting us to life are letting go as well. Issues of betrayal or abandonment come to the surface, whether our own or someone else&#x2019;s. <br><br>If it&#x2019;s a matter of the left hip, we have the case of an experience of treason or abandonment with yang (paternal) symbolism. I&#x2019;m thinking here of a person called Sylvie who had come to see me about a problem of arthrosis in her left hip just before having it operated on. After letting her speak about her physical suffering, I led her to the heart of the problem. Having her talk a little more about her life I asked, &#x201c;What man betrayed you or let you down in the last few months?&#x201d; In spite of her surprise, she confided in me that she had lost her husband three years before, but she didn&#x2019;t see any connection between these two things. I gradually explained to her the unconscious process that had taken all that time to be released in this way. She then recognized that indeed she had experienced the disappearance of her husband as an abandonment and as something that was unfair. After two sessions of harmonization massage and work on this memory, her hip was released to the point that during the second week she was able to go two complete days without feeling the slightest pain. Her fears and her professional obligations impelled her, nevertheless, to make the decision to undergo the operation, which was a &#x201c;complete success&#x201d; and silenced the pain. <br><br>But a year and a half later she came back to see me for the same problem, this time in the right hip. It was clear that she had released none of the previous internal tension. The wound in the soul had not healed and it sought another point in the body where it could express itself. I pushed her further then to speak about her experience and finally she confessed that after the disappearance of her husband she had had serious doubts about his fidelity and thought that he had cheated on her. She felt betrayed in her position as his wife. It was not surprising then that the unconscious needed to send this unresolved wound, which was kept open by doubt, into a hip. If it&#x2019;s the right hip that&#x2019;s involved, we have the case of an experience of betrayal or abandonment of yin (maternal) symbolism. This time her pain went to the right hip because her femininity was at stake, but it also went there because the left hip could no longer &#x201c;speak.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Winter Walk (American Roots)</h2><p>New England transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau&#x2019;s 1843 essay &#x201c;A Winter Walk&#x201d; is a loving celebration of winter and walking.

Mitchell]</h2><p>Dante Alighieri was born in Florence, Italy in the middle of the 13th century and what is principally known of him comes from his own writings. One of the world&#x2019;s great literary masterpieces, &#x201c;The Divine Comedy&#x201d; is at its heart an allegorical tale regarding man&#x2019;s search for divinity. The work is divided into three sections, &#x201c;Inferno&#x201d;, &#x201c;Purgatorio&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Paradiso&#x201d;, each containing thirty-three cantos. It is the narrative of a journey down through Hell, up the mountain of Purgatory, and through the revolving heavens into the presence of God. In this aspect it belongs to the two familiar medieval literary types of the Journey and the Vision, however Dante intended the work to be more than just simple allegory, layering the narrative with rich historical, moral, political, literal, and anagogical context. In order for the work to be more accessible to the common readers of his day, Dante wrote in the Italian language. This was an uncommon practice at the time for serious literary works, which would traditionally be written in Latin. One of the truly great compositions of all time, &#x201c;The Divine Comedy&#x201d; has inspired and influenced readers ever since its original creation. Presented here is the third volume of &#x201c;The Divine Comedy&#x201d; translated into English verse by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper and includes an introduction by Ellen M. Mitchell.</p><p></p><h2>Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids</h2><p>Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids recounts the exploits of 15 teenage reformatory boys evacuated in wartime to a remote mountain village where they are feared and detested by the local peasants. When plague breaks out, the villagers flee, blocking the boys inside the deserted town. Their brief attempt to build autonomous lives of self-respect, love, and tribal valor is doomed in the face of death and the adult nightmare of war.</p><p>The first novel by Japan&#39;s most celebrated living writer, Nip The Buds, Shoot the Kids recounts the exploits of fifteen teenage reformatory boys evacuated to a remote mountain village in wartime. The narrator who acts as nominal leader of the small band, his younger brother and their comrades are all delinquent outcasts, feared and detested by the local peasants. When plague breaks out, their hosts abandon them and flee, then blockade them inside the empty village, together with a young Korean, an army deserter and a girl evacuee. However, the boys&#39; brief, doomed attempt to build autonomous lives of self-respect, love and tribal valour inevitably fails with the reflux of death and the adult nightmare of war.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Japanese</p><h2>Digital Filter Design (Topics in Digital Signal Processing)</h2><p>Explains the design and implementation of digital filters on the TMS 320 Signal Processor.

Over half the working population toils away at enterprises with 500 or more employees--up from zero percent in 1800. Is this institutional immensity the logical outcome of technological forces in an all-efficient market, as some have argued? In this book, the first organizational history of nineteenth-century America, Yale sociologist Charles Perrow says no. He shows that there was nothing inevitable about the surge in corporate size and power by century's end. Critics railed against the nationalizing of the economy, against corporations' monopoly powers, political subversion, environmental destruction, and "wage slavery." How did a nation committed to individual freedom, family firms, public goods, and decentralized power become transformed in one century?</p><br><p> Bountiful resources, a mass market, and the industrial revolution gave entrepreneurs broad scope. In Europe, the state and the church kept private organizations small and required consideration of the public good. In America, the courts and business-steeped legislators removed regulatory constraints over the century, centralizing industry and privatizing the railroads. Despite resistance, the corporate form became the model for the next century. Bureaucratic structure spread to government and the nonprofits. Writing in the tradition of Max Weber, Perrow concludes that the driving force of our history is not technology, politics, or culture, but large, bureaucratic organizations.</p><br><p> Perrow, the author of award-winning books on organizations, employs his witty, trenchant, and graceful style here to maximum effect. Colorful vignettes abound: today's headlines echo past battles for unchecked organizational freedom; socially responsible alternatives that were tried are explored along with the historical contingencies that sent us down one road rather than another. No other book takes the role of organizations in America's development as seriously. The resultant insights presage a new historical genre.</p></p><p>Winner of 2003 Max Weber Award<p>"<i>Organizing America</i> is a magisterial work: a compelling analysis showing why those who study states and economies should take organizations seriously and those studying organizations should ponder how organizations have concentrated wealth and power. Perrow takes the study of organizations back to Weber's original vision, problematizing the question of why and how Western society has been transformed from community and individual to hierarchy and bureaucracy."--<b>William G. Roy, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"This book represents a long-awaited, sweeping statement by one of the leading organizational theorists of our time. Given the power, force, and even audacity of the author's arguments, it is certain to be much discussed and hotly debated."--<b>Mark S. Mizruchi, University of Michigan</b></p><p>"Charles Perrow sets his sights on those who contend that American firms became behemoths because big firms are more efficient than small ones. <i>Organizing America</i> offers a compelling alternative account, in which managers and owners created huge corporations in the process of striving for power rather than efficiency."--<b>Frank Dobbin, Princeton University</b></p></p><h2>Art, Perception, and Reality (Thalheimer Lectures)</h2><p>Explores questions relating to the nature of representation in art. It asks how we recognize likeness in caricatures or portraits, for instance, and presents the conflicting arguments and opinions of an art historian, a psychologist and a philosopher.</p><p><p>"The approach of the book is very original because it presents itself as the interdisiplinary convergance of three adopted points of view, respectively, the history of art, the psychology, and the philosophy."</p> (Pierre Somville <i>Revue Philosophique</i>)<br><br><p>"Bringing together essays by an art historian, a psychologist, and a philosopher, is an important event, for it marks a growing interest in the suggestive but very problematic relation between our experience of art and our perception of the visual world."</p> (Mark Sagoff <i>Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</i>)<br><br><p>"Power to provoke thought."</p> (Michael Rosenthal <i>Art, Perception, and Reality</i>)<br><br><p>"Stimulating and erudite. It considers the problem of likeness between a portrait and the sitter, and the role of empathy, a much neglected aspect in the nature of creating art."</p> (J.B.Deregowski <i>New Society</i>)<br><br><p>"This useful book contains three significant essays on the subject by an art historian, a psychologist, and a philosopher. Hochberg's theoretical demolition of the theory of empathy in relation to viewing art objects is of exceptional value."</p> (Peter Fuller <i>Arts Review</i>)<br><br><p>"The great achievement of this book is that it broadens the reader's perspective on the problems of representation, whatever disipline the reader considers his own. From that broadened perspective is likely to come more fruitful consideration of this set of problems."</p> (Lorraine A. Ozar <i>The Modern Schoolman</i>)<br><br><p>"Three informed opinions on the classical question of representation... Provocative."</p> (<i>Art Journal</i>)</p><h2>Improving Functional Outcomes in Physical Rehabilitation</h2><p>Here is a practical, step-by-step guide to help you understanding the treatment process and to select the most appropriate intervention for your patient.

Bates explore the cities and landscapes in which Nietzsche lived and worked.<br><br>"A brilliant juxtaposition of life and thought. . . . The sympathy of this pictorial biography is rivaled by few books on Nietzsche."&#x2014;Charles M. Stang, <i>Boston Book Review</i><br><br>"[A] distinguished addition to the Nietzsche-friendly corpus."&#x2014;Alain de Botton, <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i><br><br>"An odd and oddly endearing record of Nietzsche's travels."&#x2014;John Banville, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br></p><p>In The Good European, David Farrell Krell and Donald L. Bates explore for the first time - and with uncommon insight - Nietzsche&#39;s Epicurean appreciation of the beautiful cities and magnificent landscapes in which he lived and worked. Bringing to bear their own individual talents and training in philosophy and photography, the authors gradually immerse us in Nietzsche&#39;s aesthetic world. From Saxony to the Swiss Alps, from the Riviera to the Dolomites of Recoaro, Krell and Bates skillfully guide us, in word and image, through the course of Nietzsche&#39;s philosophical thought and continental wanderings, and along his often painful path from genius to madness. Krell&#39;s masterful translations of the thinker&#39;s most evocative writings on his work sites - many appearing here for the first time in English - merge seamlessly with Bates&#39;s penetrating photographic essays. We are, in essence, invited to share with Nietzsche, through his voice and vision, his own experience of these extraordinary sites.Donald L.

Asian-American Studies. &#34;EAST GOES WEST is a stunning testament to Younghill Kang&#39;s indomitable spirit, his perspicacious eye, and his special mirth. The book provides us with a rare view of how urban American life was experienced-and critiqued-by Korean immigrants in the 1920s&#34;-Elaine Kim. Having fled Japanese-occupied Korea for the gleaming promise of the United States, Han lands in New York with only four dollars and a suitcase full of Shakespeare to his name. Struggling to support his studies, Han becomes by turns traveling salesman, domestic worker, and farmer. In the process, he observes the idealism, greed, and shifting values of the industrializing twentieth century. In its beautifully nuanced portrayal of Han&#39;s spiritual evolution and revolutions, its richly detailed examination of a cosmopolitan immigrant subculture, and its biting portraits of racism, alienation, and hypocrisy at every level of society, EAST GOES WEST is a unique American classic.</p><p>Kang's story offers observations on the adventure of the immigrant experience along with doses of social commentary. The young protagonist, Chungpa Han, expatriates from Japanese-occupied Korea to make a life in the United States during the 1920s.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Introduction to Econometrics, Student Value Edition Plus MyLab Economics with Pearson eText -- Access Card Package (Pearson Series in Economics)</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE: </b>This loose-leaf, three-hole punched version of the textbook gives you the flexibility to take only what you need to class and add your own notes -- all at an affordable price.

These women came from all walks of life but had one thing in common: a desire for freedom. History has largely ignored these female swashbucklers, until now. Here are their stories, from ancient Norse princess Alfhild and warrior Rusla to Sayyida al-Hurra of the Barbary corsairs; from Grace O&#x2019;Malley, who terrorized shipping operations around the British Isles during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I; to Cheng I Sao, who commanded a fleet of four hundred ships off China in the early nineteenth century.<br><br>Author Laura Sook Duncombe also looks beyond the stories to the storytellers and mythmakers.

A conservative and a Catholic, from a monarchist family, he restored democracy in 1944 and brought the Communists into his government. An imperialist in the 1940s, he completed France&#x2019;s decolonization in the 1960s. A soldier, he spent much of his career opposing the army.

Mystery, myth, and misunderstanding surround this remarkable creature.</p><p>The cougar&#x2019;s range once extended from northern Canada to the tip of South America, and from the Pacific to the Atlantic, making it the most widespread animal in the western hemisphere. But overhunting and loss of habitat vastly reduced cougar numbers by the early twentieth century across much of its historical range, and today the cougar faces numerous threats as burgeoning human development encroaches on its remaining habitat.</p><p>When Maurice Hornocker began the first long-term study of cougars in the Idaho wilderness in 1964, little was known about this large cat. Its secretive nature and rarity in the landscape made it difficult to study. But his groundbreaking research yielded major insights and was the prelude to further research on this controversial species.</p><p>The capstone to Hornocker&#x2019;s long career studying big cats, <i>Cougar </i>is a powerful and practical resource for scientists, conservationists, and anyone with an interest in large carnivores.&nbsp; He and conservationist Sharon Negri bring together the diverse perspectives of twenty-two distinguished scientists to provide the fullest account of the cougar&#x2019;s ecology, behavior, and genetics, its role as a top predator, and its conservation needs. This compilation of recent findings, stunning photographs, and firsthand accounts of field research unravels the mysteries of this magnificent animal and emphasizes its importance in healthy ecosystem processes and in our lives.</p></p><p><p><b>Maurice Hornocker</b> is director of the Selway Institute. <b>Sharon Negri</b> is the director and founder of WildFutures.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Cougar </i>is a mighty compendium by twenty-two cougar authorities who share considerable first-hand experience in the field.

Written by a blue-ribbon lineup of cougar experts, this is the most exhaustive and accessible overview of the species ever produced&#x2014;it goes from showing how cougars eke out an existence in the remote Southern Andes to revealing the challenges they face negotiating superhighways in urban California and Florida. Suffering intense persecution across much of Latin America yet recovering and recolonizing former range in the United States, the adaptable cougar is a model for shaping a human future that includes large cats. <i>Cougar</i> is both timely warning and guidebook for what it will take to realize that vision.

Classical Philosophy</p><h2>Common Sense: A Political History</h2><p><p>Common sense has always been a cornerstone of American politics. In 1776, Tom Paine&#x2019;s vital pamphlet<i> </i>with that title<i> </i>sparked the American Revolution. And today, common sense&#x2014;the wisdom of ordinary people, knowledge so self-evident that it is beyond debate&#x2014;remains a powerful political ideal, utilized alike by George W. Bush&#x2019;s aw-shucks articulations and Barack Obama&#x2019;s down-to-earth reasonableness. But far from self-evident is where our faith in common sense comes from and how its populist logic has shaped modern democracy. <i>Common Sense: A Political History </i>is the first book to explore this essential political phenomenon.</p><p> </p><p> The story begins in the aftermath of England&#x2019;s Glorious Revolution, when common sense first became a political ideal worth struggling over. Sophia Rosenfeld&#x2019;s accessible and insightful account then wends its way across two continents and multiple centuries, revealing the remarkable individuals who appropriated the old, seemingly universal idea of common sense and the new strategic uses they made of it. Paine may have boasted that common sense is always on the side of the people and opposed to the rule of kings, but Rosenfeld demonstrates that common sense has been used to foster demagoguery and exclusivity as well as popular sovereignty. She provides a new account of the transatlantic Enlightenment and the Age of Revolutions, and offers a fresh reading on what the eighteenth century bequeathed to the political ferment of our own time. Far from commonsensical, the history of common sense turns out to be rife with paradox and surprise.</p></p><p>Sophia Rosenfeld is Professor of History at the University of Virginia.Breathtakingly original and daring, this book will force every reader to rethink the foundations of democracy in the modern world. (Lynn Hunt, author of <i>Inventing Human Rights: A History</i>)<br><br>Sophia Rosenfeld's superb intellectual history traces the strange birth and controversial afterlives of one of our most fundamental political concepts. Lively and learned, it sheds long-range light on contemporary anxieties about democratic populism and those who would manipulate it in the name of 'common sense.' (David Armitage, author of <i>The Declaration of Independence: A Global History</i>)<br><br>Rosenfeld illuminates one of the key ingredients of democratic-populist politics: that the common sense of the people offers a better guide to politics than the wisdom of elites. Learned and arresting, thiis book compels us to see that the rhetoric of common sense is anything but straightforward&#x2014;or common. (Daniel T. Rodgers, author of <i>Age of Fracture</i>)<br><br>A tour de force. Rosenfeld shows, as no scholar has before, how what was once a technical term in Aristotelian philosophy was transformed over the long eighteenth century to become the justification for the democratic wisdom of 'the people.' (Christopher Grasso, Editor, William and Mary Quarterly)<br><br>As Sophia Rosenfeld, a historian at the University of Virginia, shows in <i>Common Sense: A Political History</i>, common sense was invented by scientists, philosophers, and politicians. It only seems self-evident now because the idea of common sense presents itself as common-sensical, as though everyone, were he not disabused of the notion by experts, would know that he possessed it. Common sense is, as she puts it, a "slippery" idea--the kind of idea that covers its own tracks...To understand how democracy works, you have to understand the way that the crazy dream of common sense is nurtured, maintained, exploited, and defended. (Josh Rothman <i>Boston Globe blog</i> 2011-04-13)<br><br>Rosenfeld seeks to explain how the "common sense" of the people became a touchstone of political wisdom and a ubiquitous catch-phrase in political debate across the Western world...Rosenfeld is a shrewd and inventive historian. She has excavated the rhetoric of common sense from an impressive number of sites and has shaped this diverse evidence into a smart and plausible narrative. She writes with verve...Rosenfeld warns us that common sense is sometimes just an honorific that we bestow upon our prejudices. (Jeffrey Collins <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2011-04-18)<br><br>The idea of common sense pops up in many different guises throughout modern history, and one of Rosenfeld's more interesting points is that it is hardly ever utilized the same way twice...Rosenfeld rightly points out that common sense is most often utilized against some sort of Other, with politicians touting their own sensible ideas against some sort of radical, extreme ideology, whether that be liberal or conservative. In bringing the power of the vote to the people, democracy has also ensured that politicians must convince the people that they're just another one of the folks...From the populist demagoguery of the Tea Party to the social leveling provided by the Internet, common sense is now a more powerful force than ever. Myth or no, the political effects of common sense will not be going away any time soon. Rosenfeld's book may not necessarily provide an answer to all the thorny political issues of the present, but it does provide a fascinating look back through our intellectual history, and offers a excellent view of the foundations of modern populism. (Christopher Holden <i>PopMatters</i> 2011-04-29)<br><br>As Sophia Rosenfeld emphasizes in her illuminating new book, <i>Common Sense: A Political History</i>, the concept actually belongs to the realm of propaganda, power, and protest. Over the centuries, the appeal to the unerring, intuitive, and shared knowledge of average people has been the rhetorical tool of populist movements on the left as well as on the right. A claim to possess the common sense about a matter rarely ends a debate; more often it has acted as a pivot for violent disagreements as each side mobilizes its version of self-evident truth...The diligent reader is rewarded with keen insights into how the belief in plain people's access to truth has contributed to demolishing established forms of authority--whether law, tradition, or faith. (Susan Dunn <i>American Prospect</i>)<br><br>We often hear politicians and pundits speak of 'common sense.' Now Rosenfeld insightfully traces the turns the phrase has taken since it came into use in 18th-century urban centers...Her book is a model of how a fine work of history may enlighten readers about polemics without being a polemic itself. Rich, graceful, often witty, this is very highly recommended.

It chronicles the adventures of a handful of primitives from the planet Jijo who have left or been taken from their homes only to be swept into the intrigues of galactic politics. The novel also continues the story of the fugitive Earth starship <i>Streaker</i>, pursued across the galaxy for its precious cargo of ancient artifacts. Just when it looks like things can't get worse for <i>Streaker</i>, the foretold Time of Changes rocks the galaxy. Devastating "space quakes" shake every planet and star, and some of the particularly unscrupulous alien races attempt to use the disaster to further their bizarre goals. There's danger and excitement on almost every page (in contrast to much of the first two books in the series) and Brin finally delivers on many of the mysteries of the Five Galaxies. The Progenitors, the Hydrogen Breathers, <i>Streaker</i>'s cargo--these and more are explained at last. Or are they?

Glaude Jr., one of our nation&#x2019;s rising young African American intellectuals, makes an impassioned plea for black America to address its social problems by recourse to experience and with an eye set on the promise and potential of the future, rather than the fixed ideas and categories of the past. Central to Glaude&#x2019;s mission is a rehabilitation of philosopher John Dewey, whose ideas, he argues, can be fruitfully applied to a renewal of African American politics.<br> </p> <p>According to Glaude, Dewey&#x2019;s pragmatism, when attentive to the darker dimensions of life&#x2014;or what we often speak of as the blues&#x2014;can address many of the conceptual problems that plague contemporary African American discourse. How blacks think about themselves, how they imagine their own history, and how they conceive of their own actions can be rendered in ways that escape bad ways of thinking that assume a tendentious political unity among African Americans simply because they are black. Drawing deeply on black religious thought and literature, <i>In a Shade of Blue</i> seeks to dislodge such crude and simplistic thinking and replace it with a deeper understanding of and appreciation for black life in all its variety and intricacy. Glaude argues that only when black political leaders acknowledge such complexity can the real-life sufferings of many African Americans be remedied, an argument echoed in the recent rhetoric and optimism of the Barack Obama presidential campaign.</p> <p><br> </p> <p><i>I</i><i>n a Shade of Blue</i> is a remarkable work of political commentary and to follow its trajectory is to learn how African Americans arrived at this critical moment in their cultural and political history and to envision where they might head in the twenty-first century.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p><p>&#x201c;Eddie Glaude is the towering public intellectual of his generation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Cornel West<br> <br> &#x201c;Eddie Glaude is poised to become the leading intellectual voice of our generation, raising questions that make us reexamine the assumptions we hold by expanding our inventory of ideas.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tavis Smiley</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>Eddie S.

Through interviews, road stories, geographical and sociological interpretations, and detailed music criticism, Petrusich traces the rise of Americana music from its gospel origins through its new and compelling incarnations (as evidenced in bands and artists from Elvis to Iron and Wine, the Carter Family to Animal Collective, Johnny Cash to Will Oldham) and explores how the genre is adapting to the twenty-first century. Ultimately the book is an examination of all things American: guitars, cars, kids, motion, passion, enterprise, and change, in a fervent attempt to reconcile the American past with the American present, using only dusty records and highway maps as guides.</p><p>A staff writer at Pitchforkmedia.com and a senior contributing editor at <i>Paste</i>, <b>Amanda Petrusich</b> is the author of <i>Pink Moon,</i> a short book about Nick Drake's 1972 album for Continuum's 33 1/3 series.&#x201c;Like a smart, genial Persephone, Amanda Petrusich wanders the underworld of American roots music and reports back her insights with an open mind and an open heart. She has a respect for history and an even greater respect for the passion that keeps history alive and meaningful.&#x201d; &#x2014;Anthony DeCurtis, Contributing Editor, <i>Rolling Stone</i>&nbsp;"Obsessed with roots but founded on uprooting, America has always been characterized by restless internal migration: people are always leaving home to find a better, truer home. In <i>It Still Moves: Lost Songs, Lost Highways, and the Search for the American Music</i>, Amanda Petrusich hits the road too, looking to crack the conundrum of the culture that produced Robert Johnson, Lead Belly and Hank Williams but also Cracker Barrel, Graceland, and Clear Channel. Talking and listening and eating her way across an American landscape as earthy as grits 'n' gravy yet as ethereal as the wraith-like plaint of pedal steel, she finds that the mystery doesn't so much resolve as grow more vivid. In this sharply observed, intensely felt audio-travelogue, "Americana" emerges as not so much a sound or musical genre as an imaginary country, a dream land superimposed over the real U.S.A.&nbsp; Above all it's a fantasy of the South spun by people mostly not from there, a salve for that feeling of hollowness that haunts modern urban existence, a remedy for our aching sense that real life is elsewhere."&nbsp; &#x2014;Simon Reynolds, author of <i>Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-84</i>.</p><h2>Seamless: Digital Collage and Dirty Realism in Contemporary Architecture (Architecture at Rice)</h2><p>During the past fifty years, documentary photography and architecture have become increasingly interdependent, blurring the disciplinary boundary between the two. <i>Seamless </i>looks at the work of a new generation of European photographers and architects working together to produce images of architecture made from fragments of reality.

Craig provides readers with real-world practicality with underlying theory presented.<b> </b> With one half of the material from traditional mechanical engineering material, one fourth control theoretical material, and one fourth computer science, the book covers rigid-body transformations, forward and inverse positional kinematics, velocities and Jacobians of linkages, dynamics, linear control, non-linear control, force control methodologies, mechanical design aspects and programming of robots. <b> </b> For engineers. </p></p><p><p> An essential book for engineers developing robotic systems, as well as anyone involved with the mechanics, control, or programming of robotic systems. Now in its third edition, the first edition of this classic text was published approximately 20 years ago. The second edition has been in print and highly successful for 16 years. </p> <p> The book introduces the science and technology of mechanical manipulation. The third edition is organized into 13 chapters. </p> <p> Numerous exercises and a programming assignment appear at the end of each chapter. Computational aspects of problems are emphasized throughout the book. New in the third edition are MATLAB� exercises. </p><p> Scientists often have the feeling that, through their work, they are learning about some aspect of themselves. Physicists see this connection in their work; so do, for example, psychologists and chemists. In the study of robotics, the connection between the field of study and ourselves is unusually obvious. And, unlike a science that seeks only to analyze, robotics as currently pursued takes the engineering bent toward synthesis. Perhaps it is for these reasons that the field fascinates so many of us. </p> <p> The study of robotics concerns itself with the desire to synthesize some aspects of human function by the use of mechanisms, sensors, actuators, and computers. Obviously, this is a huge undertaking, which seems certain to require a multitude of ideas from various "classical" fields. </p> <p> Currently, different aspects of robotics research are carried out by experts in various fields. It is usually not the case that any single individual has the entire area of robotics in his or her grasp. A partitioning of the field is natural to expect. At a relatively high level of abstraction, splitting robotics into four major areas seems reasonable: mechanical manipulation, locomotion, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. </p> <p> This book introduces the science and engineering of mechanical manipulation. This subdiscipline of robotics has its foundations in several classical fields. The major relevant fields are mechanics, control theory, and computer science. In this book, Chapters 1 through 8 cover topics from mechanical engineering and mathematics, Chapters 9 through 11 cover control-theoretical material, and Chapters 12 and 13 might be classed as computer-science material. Additionally, the book emphasizes computational aspects of the problems throughout; for example, each chapter that is concerned predominantly with mechanics has a brief section devoted to computational considerations. </p> <p> This book evolved from class notes used to teach "Introduction to Robotics" at Stanford University during the autumns of 1983 through 1985. The first and second editions have been used at many institutions from 1986 through 2002. The third edition has benefited from this use and incorporates corrections and improvements due to feedback from many sources. Thanks to all those who sent corrections to the author. </p> <p> This book is appropriate for a senior undergraduate- or first-year graduate-level course. It is helpful if the student has had one basic course in statics and dynamics and a course in linear algebra and can program in a high-level language. Additionally, it is helpful, though not absolutely necessary, that the student have completed an introductory course in control theory. One aim of the book is to present material in a simple, intuitive way. Specifically, the audience need not be strictly mechanical engineers, though much of the material is taken from that field. At Stanford, many electrical engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians found the book quite readable. </p> <p> Directly, this book is of use to those engineers developing robotic systems, but the material should be viewed as important background material for anyone who will be involved with robotics. In much the same way that software developers have usually studied at least some hardware, people not directly involved with the mechanics and control of robots should have some such background as that offered by this text. </p> <p> Like the second edition, the third edition is organized into 13 chapters. The material will fit comfortably into an academic semester; teaching the material within an academic quarter will probably require the instructor to choose a couple of chapters to omit. Even at that pace, all of the topics cannot be covered in great depth. In some ways, the book is organized with this in mind; for example, most chapters present only one approach to solving the problem at hand. One of the challenges of writing this book has been in trying to do justice to the topics covered 'within the time constraints of usual teaching situations. One method employed to this end was to consider only material that directly affects the study of mechanical manipulation. </p> <p> At the end of each chapter is a set of exercises. Each exercise has been assigned a difficulty factor, indicated in square brackets following the exercise's number. Difficulties vary between 00 and 50, where 00 is trivial and 50 is an unsolved research problem. Of course, what one person finds difficult, another might find easy, so some readers will find the factors misleading in some cases. Nevertheless, an effort has been made to appraise the difficulty of the exercises. </p> <p> At the end of each chapter there is a programming assignment in which the student applies the subject matter of the corresponding chapter to a simple three-jointed planar manipulator. This simple manipulator is complex enough to demonstrate nearly all the principles of general manipulators without bogging the student down in too much complexity. Each programming assignment builds upon the previous ones, until, at the end of the course, the student has an entire library of manipulator software. </p> <p> Additionally, with the third edition we have added MATLAB exercises to the book. There are a total of 12 MATLAB exercises associated with Chapters 1 through 9. These exercises were developed by Prof. Robert L. Williams II of Ohio University, and we are greatly indebted to him for this contribution. These exercises can be used with the MATLAB Robotics Toolbox created by Peter Corke, Principal Research Scientist with CSIRO in Australia. </p> <p> Chapter 1 is an introduction to the field of robotics. It introduces some background material, a few fundamental ideas, and the adopted notation of the book, and it previews the material in the later chapters. </p> <p> Chapter 2 covers the mathematics used to describe positions and orientations in 3-space. This is extremely important material: By definition, mechanical manipulation concerns itself with moving objects (parts, tools, the robot itself) around in space. We need ways to describe these actions in a way that is easily understood and is as intuitive as possible. </p> <p> Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the geometry of mechanical manipulators. They introduce the branch of mechanical engineering known as kinematics, the study of motion without regard to the forces that cause it. In these chapters, we deal with the kinematics of manipulators, but restrict ourselves to static positioning problems. </p> <p> Chapter 5 expands our investigation of kinematics to velocities and static forces. </p> <p> In Chapter 6, we deal for the first time with the forces and moments required to cause motion of a manipulator. This is the problem of manipulator dynamics. </p> <p> Chapter 7 is concerned with describing motions of the manipulator in terms of trajectories through space. </p> <p> Chapter 8 many topics related to the mechanical design of a manipulator. For example, how many joints are appropriate, of what type should they be, and how should they be arranged? </p> <p> In Chapters 9 and 10, we study methods of controlling a manipulator (usually with a digital computer) so that it will faithfully track a desired position trajectory through space. Chapter 9 restricts attention to linear control methods; Chapter 10 extends these considerations to the nonlinear realm. </p> <p> Chapter 11 covers the field of active force control with a manipulator. That is, we discuss how to control the application of forces by the manipulator. This mode of control is important when the manipulator comes into contact with the environment around it, such as during the washing of a window with a sponge. </p> <p> Chapter 12 overviews methods of programming robots, specifically the elements needed in a robot programming system, and the particular problems associated with programming industrial robots. </p> <p> Chapter 13 introduces off-line simulation and programming systems, which represent the latest extension to the man-robot interface. </p> <p> I would like to thank the many people who have contributed their time to helping me with this book. First, my thanks to the students of Stanford's ME219 in the autumn of 1983 through 1985, who suffered through the first drafts, found many errors, and provided many suggestions. Professor Bernard Roth has contributed in many ways, both through constructive criticism of the manuscript and by providing me with an environment in which to complete the first edition. At SILMA Inc., I enjoyed a stimulating environment, plus resources that aided in completing the second edition. Dr. Jeff Kerr wrote the first draft of Chapter 8. Prof. Robert L. Williams II contributed the MATLAB exercises found at the end of each chapter, and Peter Corke expanded his Robotics Toolbox to support this book's style of the Denavit-Hartenberg notation. I owe a debt to my previous mentors in robotics: Marc Raibert, Carl Ruoff, Tom Binford, and Bernard Roth. </p> <p> Many others around Stanford, SILMA, Adept, and elsewhere have helped in various ways&#x2014;my thanks to John Mark Agosta, Mike Ali, Lynn Balling, A1 Barr, Stephen Boyd, Chuck Buckley, Joel Burdick, Jim Callan, Brian Carlisle, Monique Craig, Subas Desa, Tri Dai Do, Karl Garcia, Ashitava Ghosal, Chris Goad, Ron Goldman, Bill Hamilton, Steve Holland, Peter Jackson, Eric Jacobs, Johann Jager, Paul James, Jeff Kerr, Oussama Khatib, Jim Kramer, Dave Lowe, Jim Maples, Dave Marimont, Dave Meer, Kent Ohlund, Madhusudan Raghavan, Richard Roy, Ken Salisbury, Bruce Shimano, Donalda Speight, Bob Tilove, Sandy Wells, and Dave Williams. </p> <p> The students of Prof. Roth's Robotics Class of 2002 at Stanford used the second edition and forwarded many reminders of the mistakes that needed to get fixed for the third edition. </p> <p> Finally I wish to thank Tom Robbins at Prentice Hall for his guidance with the first edition and now again with the present edition. </p> <p> J.J.C. </p></p><h2>Fundamentals of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (Fundamentals of Complementary and Integrative Medicine)</h2><p><p>Focusing on emerging therapies and those best supported by clinical trials and scientific evidence, <b>Fundamentals of Complementary and Alternative Medicine</b> describes some of the most prevalent and the fastest-growing CAM therapies in use today.

H. Elliott steps back from his work to consider the progress of historical scholarship. From his own experiences as a historian of Spain, Europe, and the Americas, he provides a deft and sharp analysis of the work that historians do and how the field has changed since the 1950s.</p><p>The author begins by explaining the roots of his interest in Spain and its past, then analyzes the challenges of writing the history of a country other than one's own. In succeeding chapters he offers acute observations on such topics as the history of national and imperial decline, political history, biography, and art and cultural history. Elliott concludes with an assessment of changes in the approach to history over the past half-century, including the impact of digital technology, and argues that a comprehensive vision of the past remains essential. Professional historians, students of history, and those who read history for pleasure will find in Elliott's delightful book a new appreciation of what goes into the shaping of historical works and how those works in turn can shape the world of thought and action.</p></p><p><p><b>Sir John Elliott</b> is a prize-winning historian and Regius Professor Emeritus of Modern History, University of Oxford.

Colin Adams, humor columnist for the <i>Mathematical Intelligencer</i> and one of today's most outlandish and entertaining popular math writers, demonstrates how in this zombie adventure novel.</p><p><i>Zombies and Calculus</i> is the account of Craig Williams, a math professor at a small liberal arts college in New England, who, in the middle of a calculus class, finds himself suddenly confronted by a late-arriving student whose hunger is not for knowledge. As the zombie virus spreads and civilization crumbles, Williams uses calculus to help his small band of survivors defeat the hordes of the undead. Along the way, readers learn how to avoid being eaten by taking advantage of the fact that zombies always point their tangent vector toward their target, and how to use exponential growth to determine the rate at which the virus is spreading. Williams also covers topics such as logistic growth, gravitational acceleration, predator-prey models, pursuit problems, the physics of combat, and more. With the aid of his story, you too can survive the zombie onslaught.</p><p>Featuring easy-to-use appendixes that explain the book's mathematics in greater detail, <i>Zombies and Calculus</i> is suitable both for those who have only recently gotten the calculus bug, as well as for those whose disease has advanced to the multivariable stage.</p></p><p><p>"If you're dying to read a novel treatment of calculus, then you should run (don't walk!) to buy <i>Zombies and Calculus</i> by Colin Adams. You'll see calculus come alive in a way that could save your life someday."<b>--Arthur Benjamin, Harvey Mudd College</b></p><p>"Before <i>Zombies and Calculus</i>, math was quick to kill my appetite. In fact, math damn near killed me altogether throughout most of college (it is of course a clich� to say that as a math student I was pretty much a zombie). If I had only had this book then . . . at least now I can stomach derivatives as well as a zombie outbreak. That's no small accomplishment! Read <i>Zombies and Calculus</i>--you'll laugh . . . you'll cry . . . you'll multiply."<b>--Steven C. Schlozman, M.D., author of <i>The Zombie Autopsies</i></b></p><p>"Using a fictional, tongue-in-cheek account of an outbreak of a zombie virus at a small liberal arts college, Adams discusses mathematical subjects such as the spread of a disease in a population, differential equations, and tangent vectors. He succeeds in conveying the idea that calculus is useful in numerous aspects of life--including surviving a zombie apocalypse. The book is one of a kind."<b>--Joel Hass, University of California, Davis</b></p><p>"<i>Zombies and Calculus</i> shows how calculus can be used to understand many different real-world phenomena, from population growth to Newton's law of cooling. The fast-paced narrative propels readers forward, and Adams's style is humorous and compelling. I laughed out loud, in public, several times while reading this book. I had a hard time putting it down."<b>--Amy N. Myers, Bryn Mawr College</b></p><p>"<i>Zombies and Calculus</i> is unlike just about anything I've ever read. It is both an introduction to assorted math concepts and an action-packed adventure story about escaping a zombie invasion. It's also laugh-out-loud funny in many places."<b>--Meredith L. Greer, Bates College</b></p><b>Colin Adams</b> is professor of mathematics at Williams College and the author of many books, including <i>How to Ace Calculus: The Streetwise Guide</i>. He is also the humor columnist for <i>Mathematical Intelligencer</i>.</p><h2>Dracula</h2><p>Of the many admiring reviews Bram Stoker's <b>Dracula</b> received when it first appeared in 1897, the most astute praise came from the author's mother, who wrote her son: "It is splendid. No book since Mrs. Shelley's <b>Frankenstein</b> or indeed any other at all has come near yours in originality, or terror."<br><br>A popular bestseller in Victorian England, Stoker's hypnotic tale of the bloodthirsty Count Dracula, whose nocturnal atrocities are symbolic of an evil ages old yet forever new, endures as the quintessential story of suspense and horror. The unbridled lusts and desires, the diabolical cravings that Stoker dramatized with such mythical force, render <b>Dracula</b> resonant and unsettling a century later.</p><p><i>Dracula</i> is one of the few horror books to be honored by inclusion in the Norton Critical Edition series. (The others are <i>Frankenstein,</i> <i>The Turn of the Screw,</i> <i>Heart of Darkness,</i> <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray,</i> and <i>The Metamorphosis.</i>) This 100th-anniversary edition includes not only the complete authoritative text of the novel with illuminating footnotes, but also four contextual essays, five reviews from the time of publication, five articles on dramatic and film variations, and seven selections from literary and academic criticism. Nina Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania (author of <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>) and horror scholar David J. Skal (author of <i>Hollywood Gothic</i>, <i>The Monster Show</i>, and <i>Screams of Reason</i>) are the editors of the volume. Especially fascinating are excerpts from materials that Bram Stoker consulted in his research for the book, and his working papers over the several years he was composing it. The selection of criticism includes essays on how <i>Dracula</i> deals with female sexuality, gender inversion, homoerotic elements, and Victorian fears of "reverse colonization" by politically turbulent Transylvania.While serving as actor Henry Irving&#39;s business manager at the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker (1847-1912) also pursued his literary interests. In this Gothic horror novel of 1897, which brought him international fame, he presents the chilling vampire Count Dracula, modelled in part on Irving&#39;s powerful personality.</p><h2>AAPC Official CPC Certification Study Guide 2017</h2><p>AAPC&#39;s Official CPC� Certification Study guide is specifically designed to help individuals prepare for the CPC� exam.

Mary Beth writes a nationally syndicated column, which can be viewed at www.marybethbrown.net, and is a frequent guest on radio and TV.Reader Chris Fabry fully captures the devotional tone intended by the author. Mary Beth Brown, who reads the preface, admits that her book is not a scholarly work on Reagan's Christian faith; rather, its aim is to inspire people about Christianity. The book focuses on Reagan's relationships with his wife, his children, his parents, and other members of his family, and the place of his faith in those relationships. It allows readers to see Reagan not simply as a politician, but as a husband, father, and friend. As a bonus for Reagan fans, this audiobook contains the eulogies of Margaret Thatcher, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and the Reagan children delivered at Reagan's memorial service.

The nameless narrator, a writer, shares his most intimate thoughts about his wife, their life together, and her death. But just as death is inseparable from life, his wife seems still to be with him. Her memory and words permeate his days. In <i>The Old Man&#x2019;s Love Story</i>, master storyteller Rudolfo Anaya crafts the tale of a lifelong love that ultimately transcends death.</p><p>An elegy not just for the dead but for the vitality of youth, the old man&#x2019;s story captures both the heartaches and ironies of old age. We follow him as he proceeds through days of grief and memory, buying his few groceries, driving slower than the other travelers on the road. He talks with his wife along the way. &#x201c;Go slow,&#x201d; he hears her admonish. As he sits in the garden with their dogs, he senses her worry over his loneliness. A year passes. He longs to care for someone, but&#x2014;to love again?</p><p>Like characters in Anaya&#x2019;s previous fiction, the old man lives in a real New Mexico, but one inhabited by spirits. Death provides a gateway to other worlds, just as memories connect him to other times and places. When he eventually begins a new friendship with a woman, a widow, they share a bittersweet understanding of joy mixed with sorrow, promise mixed with loss.</p><p>Anaya&#x2019;s reflections, as shared through the experiences of this old man, point to the power and importance of love at every stage of life. Lyrical and earthy, sad yet suffused with humor,<i> The Old Man&#x2019;s Love Story</i> will speak to all readers, perhaps especially to those who have suffered a recent loss.</p></p><p><p><b>Rudolfo Anaya </b>is Professor Emeritus of English at the University of New Mexico and award-winning author of numerous books including the classic <i>Bless Me, Ultima. </i>He has received myriad awards and honors for his work including Western Writers of America&#x2019;s Owen Wister Award (2018), the National Humanities Medal (2015), the National Medal of Arts (2001) and the Robert Kirsch Award for lifetime achievement from the Los Angeles Times Book Prizes (2012). He lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the Southwest has served as an inspiration for his writing throughout his life.</p>"This heartbreaking fable comes from a deep well of experience and wisdom. Rudolfo Anaya is not concerned with fashion, or fame. He is writing with blood. This is a book for everyone who has ever loved, for everyone who has grieved, and for everyone who has ever hoped, in the darkest night, that what is essential goes on possibly forever.

These include the ways games can marry pleasure, learning and mastery through the sense of ownership, agency and control players enjoy when gaming, as well as controversial issues surrounding games. The book explores relationships between values, identity, content and learning, and focuses on how to understand and explain many young people&#x2019;s differential experiences of learning in gaming and schooling respectively.</p><p>"Gee is at his masterful best in this brilliant collection. No one speaks with more insight and clarity when it comes to the learning potential of videogames. Gee seeks nothing short of a revolution; we will do well to follow his lead." <i>Katie Salen, Associate Professor, Parsons the New School for Design; Executive Director, Gamelab Institute of Play</i> <p>"<i>Good Video Games and Good Learning</i> is packed with deep insight about games and learning. If you are creating games or studying them, if you are using games to educate or just want a sneak peek at the future of learning, then you must read this book. Gee doesn't focus on educational games: he shows how any good game is a context for learning-and conversely, what educators can learn from games. His aim is not to tell teachers how to teach, or to tell game creators how to make better games-but instead to bridge the gap between the two. In doing so, Gee presents essential ideas about game design and game experience, cognition and pleasure, and learning both in and out of the classroom-all with the playful rigor and clear thinking we have come to expect from this eminent scholar (and expert player) of games. If you read one book on games and learning this year, read <i>Good Video Games and Good Learning</i>.

It is the only text of its kind to offer writing advice from such authors, editors, and instructors as Francine Prose, Joyce Carol Oates, Frank Conroy, Andre Dubus, Robert Coles, Tom Bailey, and C. Michael Curtis, with a foreword by Tobias Wolff. These experts give voice--voices--to a dialogue about the art and craft of writing short stories. <br> Respecting writers' autonomy, <em>On Writing Short Stories</em> does not offer a rigidly systematic apparatus for learning to write short stories. Instead it asks what makes a short story, analyzes various aspects of craft, discusses process and revision, and also pauses to wonder why people write short stories at all. It considers the importance of reading and of peer critique in workshops as integral components of the learning process and offers advice on how to get short stories published. <br> Ideal for courses and workshops in creative writing, <em>On Writing Short Stories</em> also includes an engaging selection of eighteen short stories, both classic and contemporary, for discussion and analysis. These stories stretch the limits of narrative fiction; reading them will help students create a scaffolding for the short story form. Writing exercises are incorporated to help students put the craft into practice for themselves. A list of addresses and editors of magazines, journals, and quarterlies that publish short fiction is also included for writers who are ready to begin submitting their work for consideration.</p><p>Don't overlook the <i>On</i> in the title of <i>On Writing Short Stories</i>. Though there is a chapter by its editor, Tom Bailey, on the elements of short fiction, the book explores a variety of issues of interest to short-story writers. Francine Prose grapples with the what-constitutes-a-short-story question: "Great short stories make us marvel at their integrity, their economy," she writes. "If we went at them with our blue pencils, we might find we had nothing to do." Joyce Carol Oates ponders reading as a writer, Andre Dubus contemplates the habit of writing, and Robert Coles explores "literatures as a means of understanding human affairs."<p> C. Michael Curtis, writer of 30 to 40 rejection letters daily as senior editor for <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, tells how best to ensure that your short-fiction submissions receive "friendly consideration." And University of Iowa Writers' Workshop director Frank Conroy weighs in on the writer's workshop and what he sees as the mistaken belief that workshops imprint themselves upon their students' work. "Art cannot be made by committee," he writes. "The student ... should not be looking for solutions from the other students or from the teacher. The student should be looking for problems in the text that he or she had not been aware of." Also here are writing exercises; a list of magazines, journals, and quarterlies that publish short fiction; and 18 classic short stories, including de Maupassant's "The String," Tillie Olsen's "I Stand Here Ironing," and Tim O'Brien's "The Things They Carried." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Thomas Bailey is at Harvard University.</p><h2>Theory of Machines and Mechanisms</h2><p><em>Theory of Machines and Mechanisms </em>provides a text for the complete study of displacements, velocities, accelerations, and static and dynamic forces required for the proper design of mechanical linkages, cams, and geared systems. The authors present the background, notation, and nomenclature essential for students to understand the various independent technical approaches that exist in the field of mechanisms, kinematics, and dynamics.<br><br>Now fully revised in its fourth edition, this text is ideal for senior undergraduate or graduate students in mechanical engineering who are taking a course in kinematics and/or machine dynamics.</p><p><br>John J.

With these words, Roland Barthes describes a concept that profoundly shaped his work and was the subject of a landmark series of lectures delivered in 1978 at the Coll�ge de France, just two years before his death. Not published in France until 2002, and appearing in English for the first time, these creative and engaging lectures deepen our understanding of Roland Barthes's intellectual itinerary and reveal his distinctive style as thinker and teacher. <br><br>The Neutral (<i>le neutre</i>), as Barthes describes it, escapes or undoes the paradigmatic binary oppositions that structure and produce meaning in Western thought and discourse. These binaries are found in all aspects of human society ranging from language to sexuality to politics. For Barthes, the attempt to deconstruct or escape from these binaries has profound ethical, philosophical, and linguistic implications. <br><br><i>The Neutral</i> is comprised of the prewritten texts from which Barthes lectured and centers around 23 "figures," also referred to as "traits" or "twinklings," that are possible embodiments of the Neutral (sleep, silence, tact, etc.) or of the anti-Neutral (anger, arrogance, conflict, etc.). His lectures draw on a diverse set of authors and intellectual traditions, including Lao-tzu, Tolstoy, German mysticism, classical philosophy, Rousseau, Baudelaire, Walter Benjamin, and John Cage. Barthes's idiosyncratic approach to his subjects gives the lectures a playful, personal, and even joyous quality that enhances his rich insights.<br><br>In addition to his reflections on a variety of literary and scholarly works, Barthes's personal convictions and the events of his life shaped the course and content of the lectures. Most prominently, as Barthes admits, the recent death of his mother and the idea of mourning shape several of his lectures.</p><p>Roland Barthes was one of the most influential critics and philosophers of the twentieth century.

The first half of the eighteenth century was pervaded by the spirit of Baroque, epitomized most completely in palaces and churches: Schonbrunn in Vienna, the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg or the dazzlingly theatrical churches and Residenzes of Germany and Central Europe. After 1750 architecture turned away from Baroque towards Neo-classicism, whose most characteristic types included private houses, institutional buildings and planned towns--Bath, Philadelphia and Washington, with their theatres, museums, hospitals and banks.Architectural historian Sir John Summerson, professor of fine art in Britain and curator for 39 years at Sir John Soane's Museum describes the rise of neoclassicism after 1750. Making the point that the transition from Baroque was marked by "a plurality of styles," Summerson goes on to provide a historical context for the changeover, examines town-planning and looks at individual buildingsmuseums, libraries, prisons, theaters and banks. In the concluding chapter he discerns the echoes of Versailles in Washington, D.C., which he judges "the one great triumph of urban planning in 18th century America." Some 174 illustrations, consisting of plans, photographs and drawings, embellish this satisfying summary of the period. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Chaucer and the Late Medieval World: The Poet and the Late Medieval World</h2><p>Divided between the outer world of affairs and the inner world of poetic insight, Chaucer sought to make sense of his changing, conflicting world.

Their primary goal was to redress the neglect of the general problem of utility assessment in complex decision situations that are formulated in the (subjective) expected utility or decision analysis mode, and to illustrate the usefulness of their approach across a broad spectrum of important decision problems. The mathematical developments that are included are there because they can be used to help people think about their preferences in complex situations and to assess their utility functions - if it comes to that - and not because they are pretty mathematics.

Craig Wheeler takes us on a breathtaking journey to supernovae, black holes, gamma-ray bursts and adventures in hyperspace. This is no far-fetched science fiction tale, but an enthusiastic exploration of ideas at the cutting edge of current astrophysics. Wheeler follows the tortuous life of a star from birth to evolution and death, and goes on to consider the complete collapse of a star into a black hole, worm-hole time machines, the possible birth of baby bubble universes, and the prospect of a revolutionary view of space and time in a ten-dimensional string theory. Along the way he offers evidence that suggests the Universe is accelerating and describes recent developments in understanding gamma-ray bursts--perhaps the most catastrophic cosmic events of all. With the use of lucid analogies, simple language and crystal-clear cartoons, Cosmic Catastrophes makes accessible some of the most exciting and mind-bending objects and ideas in the Universe. J.

These included mock trials, debate, Socratic dialog, simulated congressional hearings, role-playing, cooperative learning, moral dilemmas, deep concept exploration, problem solving, research in public policy, hearings, good lectures, docudramas, and community resources. All of these ideas represent very good teaching and useful teaching strategies. Note, however, that not one social studies expert mentioned the use of primary sources. Written history is based on primary sources such as official documents, letters, diaries, oral histories, speeches, newspaper articles, and other archival materials. </p> <p> This book seeks to resurrect history as an integral part of civic education. As social studies evolved into a broad field of study, history, as a subject, lost its central role. The study of history loses its importance when students do not realize that significant knowledge of the past is based on the interpretation of factual data. Knowing about the past gives meaning to the present and may give hints as to what will happen in the future. </p> <p><b>How Do We Effectively Teach History?</b></p> <p> How can history be taught effectively? That is the question! Should we lecture? David M. Kennedy and Michael Whelan assure us that a good story is a powerful way to help students learn. Kennedy, a Stanford University history professor who has written a well-known AP U.S. history textbook, states, "There is something innate in the human mind that makes the narrative form an especially attractive medium in which to contain, transmit, and remember important information." Whelan remarks, "If you are going to lecture, you had better make it memorable." </p> <p> How often should we lead classroom discussions? Discussions of content help students formulate their thinking about history. How can we ensure that all students have an opportunity to participate in an informed way during discussions? How can we generate informed discussions that avoid opining and "blather," which are often the pitfalls of discussions? </p> <p> When and how do we introduce students to primary sources? Primary sources offer a rich contextual understanding of the past. How can we help students analyze primary sources and make connections to a larger narrative of the past? How do we connect our teaching with national and state standards? How should we evaluate students' knowledge and understanding of history? </p> <p> This book responds to these questions as we explore the following key elements of history instruction: </p> <ul> <li>Student involvement in historical inquiry</li> <li>The careful integration of primary sources and narratives in the teaching of history</li> <li>Teaching toward chronological thinking and vital themes and narratives with historians' habits of mind</li> <li>The use of historical documents to develop in students a detective approach to solving historical problems</li> <li>The use of a systematic approach to improve students' historical thinking</li> <li>The use of deliberative discussions, in a controlled setting, to develop a durable framework of historical knowledge</li> <li>The use of practical means of evaluation to measure the level of students' learning</li> </ul> <p> Teachers will be able to apply our ideas for selecting content, methods of instruction, and assessment of student learning. The methods we present in this book are a powerful means to develop students' understanding of history and their ability to use this knowledge in discussing issues past and present. These methods are not novel or magical, but they are useful and effective. This book emphasizes certain strategies that will help students know more about the past in ways that will help them in their lives today. </p> <p><b>How Is This Book Organized?</b></p> <p> This book comprises three parts. In part I, we describe the theoretical background to teaching history. In chapter 1, Teaching History, we deal with the present world situation in teaching history. We suggest a theme of freedom and provide interrelated questions you can pose to organize your history course. What are the meanings of freedom in the United States and in the world? What are the political conditions and social conditions that make freedom possible in the United States and in the world? What are the boundaries of freedom in the United States and in the world and how have they been reduced as well as expanded? Moreover, why is history important for your students? Why is historical inquiry important? </p> <p> In chapter 2, The History of Teaching History, we describe the history of your profession. When, how, and why did history emerge as a subject for study in schools? We provide an overview of the circumstances that gave rise to the teaching of history in the early American experience, and we examine 20th century controversies surrounding history and the social studies. Why have history and social studies become contested areas in the curriculum? </p> <p> In chapter 3, Historical Thinking, we establish an instructional and cognitive framework for your instructional strategies. What is historical thinking? Why is historical thinking important for all students? </p> <p> In part II, Planning and Assessment, we emphasize that teaching involves organizing your courses and creating ways to assess what your students learn. In chapter 4, Organizing Your History Courses: Making Content Choices, we discuss chronological and Thematic organization for teaching history. How is such organization helpful? </p> <p> In chapter 5, Lesson and Unit Planning, we offer suggestions for creating both lesson and unit plans in teaching history. How does long-range planning help students learn history? What are the common features of all lesson plans? How are unit plans developed? </p> <p> In chapter 6, Creating Historical Understanding and Communication through Performance Assessment, we deal with the need to assess your students' knowledge, reasoning power, and effective use of communication in the setting of a history classroom. How can assessment go beyond the typical multiple-choice test? How can you create an effective authoritative rubric to share with your students? </p> <p> In part III, Instruction, we focus on the use of primary sources, discussion, images, and writing in teaching history. In chapter 7, Using Primary Sources: The First-, Second-, and Third-Order Approach, we discuss typologies of primary sources, how to choose primary sources, and how to use an inquiry method in teaching history. Whereas chapter 3 provides a theoretical grounding for the first-, second-, and third-order approach, chapter 7 offers practical illustrations for you to use in the classroom. How can primary sources become an integral part of teaching and learning? How can primary sources be used effectively in teaching? </p> <p> In chapter 8, Considering and Doing Discussion in History Teaching, we focus on deliberative discussions and the use of first-, second-, and third-order documents. How are deliberative discussions distinguished from other types of classroom discussions? How does the approach we suggest give your teaching an intellectual direction? </p> <p> In chapter 9, Using Historical Images to Engage Your Students in the Past, we provide three teaching strategies to incorporate photographs and paintings in the teaching of history, among other strategies. How do visuals contribute to the teaching and learning of history? How can you involve students in actively analyzing images (rather than depending on you to do it for them)? </p> <p> In chapter 10, Using Writing to Engage Your Students in the Past, we describe effective writing assignments related to teaching history. What strategies can you use to encourage writing in the history classroom? How does writing improve knowledge and understanding of historical content? </p> <p> Our conclusion points to the need for good history teaching in the 21st century. We summarize the importance of history as a subject in the curriculum, the use of primary sources, and the value of deliberative discussion for developing lifelong learners. Above all, we hope that what follows will be useful as you begin your role as a scholar, teacher, and student of history and the social sciences. </p> <p><b>What Are the Special Features?</b></p> <p> Both the study of history and the teaching of history are multifaceted. Throughout this book we intersperse 25 <b>Ideas for the History Classroom</b> to help both new and experienced history teachers engage students in inquiry and discussions. We also provide teachers of methods courses with chapter-ending activities under the heading <b>Translating History into Classroom Practice.</b> These activities can be readily used in a History Education, Social Science Education, or Social Studies Education Methods course. </p> <p> We make no pretense herein to cover all the best practices of a classroom teacher and methods teacher. We do, however, hope that our book engages new and experienced teachers in thoughtful discourse regarding the teaching and learning of history. </p></p><h2>1000 Masterpieces of European Painting: From 1300 to 1850</h2><p>Used.

These lands, in what is now northern England and southeast Scotland, were the targets of the first Viking raids on Britain. This violent influx, followed by the establishment of trade routes with the Norse, brought the runes to the region, where they intermingled with local magical traditions and legends, resulting in the development of a practical runic wisdom entirely unique to Northumbria. <br><br>In this guide to the Wyrdstaves, or runic practices, of Old Northumbria, Nigel Pennick examines the thirty-three runes of the Anglo-Saxon Futhark and how they were used in Old England for weaving the web of Wyrd. Sharing runic lore and legends from the area, he explains how the Northumbrian runes are unique because they contain elements from all the cultures of the region, including the Picts, Britons, Romans, Angles, Scots, and Norse. He illustrates how each rune in this tradition is a storehouse of ancient knowledge, detailing the meanings, historical uses, symbolism, and related tree and plant spirits for each of the thirty-three runes. The author describes the Northumbrian use of runes in magic and encryption and explores geomancy divination practices, the role of sacred numbers, and the power of the eight airts, or directions. He also shows how the Northumbrian runes have a close relationship with Ogam, the tree alphabet of the ancient Celts. <br><br>Providing a magical history of Northumbria, as well as a look at the otherworldly beings who call these lands home, including boggarts, brownies, and dragons, Pennick explains how traditional spirituality is intimately tied to the landscape and the cycle of the seasons. He reveals how the runic tradition is still vibrantly alive in this area and ready for us to reawaken to it.</p><p>Nigel Pennick is an authority on ancient belief systems, traditions, runes, and geomancy and has traveled and lectured extensively in Europe and the United States.

More and more CEOs are failing; there remains an acute shortage of capable replacements. The true dilemma in leadership is the stagnant state of corporate leadership development. Because companies fail to hone their unit managers' leadership abilities, they are never able to fill their succession pipelines. With unit managers stagnating, companies have difficulty executing at every level, compounding the crisis. In I&gt;Leaders at All Levels, bestselling author Ram Charan shows how top companies approach leadership development as a core competency, recognizing that an adaptable leadership pool is a competitive advantage, and focusing their attention on bringing out the best in the leaders they have.</p> <p>Charan reveals exactly what's wrong with corporate leadership development and tells how to make it right. He explains the concept of a leadership "gene pool" and shows how companies can discover just what "DNA" they need to succeed. He also details how to uncover the hidden leaders in a company, when and where to bring in fresh talent, how to coach, measure, and reward leadership, and much more. For CEOs, directors, and anyone involved in leadership development, <i>Leaders at All Levels</i> is an eye-opening guide on how to get succession right.</p></p><p><p><b>LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS</b> </p><p><i>"CRISIS MAY BE AN OVERUSED WORD, but it's a fair description of the state of leadership in today's corporations. CEOs are failing sooner, and falling harder, leaving companies in turmoil. At all levels, companies are short on the quantity and quality of leaders they need." --</i>From the Introduction </p><p>In <i>Leaders at All Levels, </i> Ram Charan addresses a pressing problem--a shortfall of leaders prepared to face today's complex business challenges. When so many companies struggle to find successors for their top jobs, and when so many leaders rise to the top only to fail shortly after getting there, you know there's something wrong with our leadership development practices. </p><p>In this book, Ram Charan presents a radical and controversial remedy for the crisis in leadership: the Apprenticeship Model. This new approach to succession and to leadership development makes it a hands-on activity for leaders and their bosses. People with the talent for leadership get stiff challenges hand-picked for them. Their bosses play a crucial role in accelerating their development. HR gets a new job, as trustee of the Apprenticeship system. Leaders at all levels develop faster and better, and boards have better choices when it comes time to choose the next CEO. </p><p>New but not untested, this approach works because it is based on Charan's keen insights into how great business leaders actually develop. Having worked closely with many successful leaders over several decades, Charan concluded that: </p><ul> <li>Leaders are different from other people</li> <li>Leaders develop their talent through practice and self-correction</li> </ul> <p>Filled with down-to-earth advice and real-world examples, <i>Leaders at All Levels</i> gives you the tools you need to create an enduring legacy of leadership excellence. It also gives individual leaders a road map for taking charge of their own growth.</p><p><b>PRAISE FOR LEADERS AT ALL LEVELS</b> </p><p>"Ram Charan's wisdom and experience come through in the profound insights that underlie this simple approach to building a better leadership pool. Any company concerned about its bench strength should follow this original and practical approach to developing leaders." <br> &#x2015;<b>Chad Holliday</b>, chairman and CEO, DuPont </p><p>"Trusted by the cream of corporate leadership worldwide, Ram Charan uniquely blends the human reality of ultimately having to choose less-than-perfect leaders (a challenge all boards face) with a practical approach, for identifying and nurturing exceptional leaders." &#x2015;<b>Bob Lane</b>, chairman and CEO, Deere &amp; Company </p><p>"<i>Leaders at All Levels</i> is a practical and no-nonsense approach to building the talent pool which will differentiate your organization, now and in the future.

It gives a history of the related processes of colonization and "housewifization" and extends this analysis to the contemporary new international division of labor and the role that women have to play as the cheapest producers and consumers. First published in 1986, it was hailed as a major paradigm shift for feminist theory. Eleven years on, Maria Mies' theory of capitalist patriarchy has become even more relevant; this new edition includes a substantial new introduction in which she both applies her theory to the new globalized world and answers her critics.<br></p><p>Maria Mies is a Marxist feminist scholar who is renowned for her theory of capitalist patriarchy, which recognizes third world women and difference. She is a professor of sociology at Cologne University of Applied Sciences, but retired from teaching in 1993. Since the late 1960s she has been involved with feminist activism. In 1979, at the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague, she founded the Women and Development programme.

Combining&nbsp;the magazine's&nbsp;original art with the revised text from the story's subsequent publication in&nbsp;book form, this edition boasts more than&nbsp;fifty of Goble's black-and-white illustrations, providing an unforgettable visceral and atmospheric accompaniment to H. G. Wells's classic tale.</p><p>This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..." <p> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. <i>--Craig E.

Page by page, Derman details his adventures in this field&#x2014;analyzing the incompatible personas of traders and quants, and discussing the dissimilar nature of knowledge in physics and finance. Throughout this tale, he also reflects on the appropriate way to apply the refined methods of physics to the hurly-burly world of markets.</p><p>Wall Street is no longer the old-fashioned business it once was. In recent years, investment banks and hedge funds have increasingly turned to quantitative trading strategies and derivative securities for their profits, and have raided academia for PhDs to model these volatile products and manage their risk. Nowadays, the fortunes of firms and the stability of markets often rest on mathematical models. "Quants"&#x2013;the scientifically trained practitioners of quantitative finance who build these models&#x2013;have become key players on the Wall Street stage. <p>And no Wall Street quant is better known than Emanuel Derman. One of the first high-energy particle physicists to migrate to Wall Street, he spent seventeen years in the business, eventually becoming managing director and head of the renowned Quantitative Strategies group at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. There he coauthored some of today&#x2019;s most widely used and influential financial models.</p> <p>Physics and quantitative finance look deceptively similar. But, writes Derman, "When you do physics you&#x2019;re playing against God; in finance, you&#x2019;re playing against God&#x2019;s creatures." How can one justify using the precise methods of physics in the frenzied world of financial markets? Is it reasonable to treat the economy and its markets as a complex machine? Or is quantitative finance merely flawed thinking masquerading as science, a brave whistling in the dark?</p> <p>My Life as a Quant is Derman&#x2019;s entertaining and candid account of his search for answers as he undergoes his transformation from ambitious young scientist to managing director. His book is simultaneously wide-ranging and personal. He tells the story of his passage between two worlds; he recounts his adventures with physicists, quants, options traders, and other highfliers on Wall Street; he analyzes the incompatible personas of traders and quants; and he meditates on the dissimilar natures of knowledge in physics and finance. Throughout his tale, he reflects on the appropriate way to apply the refined methods of physics to the hurly-burly world of markets.</p> <p>My Life as a Quant is a unique first-person story and a perceptive and revealing exploration of the quantitative side of Wall Street.</p>Praise for My Life as a Quant <p><i>"My Life as a Quant,</i> by Emanuel Derman is, indeed, a perfect memoir, as Derman, a South African&#x2013;born physicist turned financial engineer, is a perfect memoirist." --Grant's Interest Rate Observer</p> <p>"That sense of being an intruder in outlaw territory lends an intriguing mood to Derman's <i>My Life as a Quant</i>, a literate and entertaining memoir."--BusinessWeek</p> <p>"Derman's memoir of his transition from mathematical physicist to expert finance whiz at Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers reads like a novel, but tells a lot about brains applied to making money grow."--Paul A. Samuelson, MIT, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, 1970</p> <p>"Elegantly written by a gifted observer who was a pioneering member of the new profession of financial engineering with an evident affection both for finance as a science and for the scientists who practice it. Derman's portrait of how the academics brought their new financial science to the world of business and his descriptions of the late and extraordinary genius Fischer Black who became his mentor, reveal a surprising humanity where it might be least expected."--Stephen Ross, Franco Modigliani Professor of Finance and Economics, Sloan School, MIT</p> <p>" a deep and elegant exploration by a thinker who moved from the hardest of all sciences (physics) to the softest of the soft (finance).

Carlson identifies and examines four distinct cycles of strength or weakness of American family systems. This distinctly American family model includes early and nearly universal marriage, high fertility, close attention to parental responsibilities, complementary gender roles, meaningful intergenerational bonds, and relative stability. Notably, such traits distinguish the &#x201c;strong&#x201d; American family system from the &#x201c;weak&#x201d; European model (evident since 1700), which involves late marriage, a high proportion of the adult population never married, significantly lower fertility, and more divorces.</p> <p>The author shows that these cycles of strength and weakness have occurred, until recently, in remarkably consistent fifty-year swings in the United States since colonial times. The book&#x2019;s chapters are organized around these 50-year time frames. There have been four family cycles of strength and decline since 1630, each one lasting about one hundred years. The author argues that fluctuations within this cyclical model derive from intellectual, economic, cultural, and religious influences, which he explores in detail, and supports with considerable evidence.</p> <p></p></p><p><p>Allan C.

It was during a visit to the Netherlands that he came across the work of Van Huysum. So entranced was he by the Dutch floral paintings that, despite working for his brother painting theatre sets during a lean period in his life, he managed to find time to paint small floral water-colours which soon attracted the attention of leading botanists of the time. Inspired by Empress Josephine&#39;s garden at Malmaison Chateau in Paris, he collaborated with botanist Claude-Antoine Thory to produce &#34;Les Roses&#34;, originally intended as a scientific work but which soon became, due to Redoute&#39;s illustrations, a collectors item which captured the public&#39;s imagination with its beauty. Printed in sections between 1817 and 1824 it soon sold out and unfortunately the actual paintings were destroyed in a fire in the Library of the Louvre. However,the prints have been reproduced time and time again to perpetuate their beauty and inspire future generations. This concise edition, with close-ups of many of the prints, is prettily presented in a boxed set which includes 12 notelets of Redoute&#39;s paintings making it the perfect gift for any rose lover.</p><h2>Fault Lines</h2><p>A best seller in France, with over 400,000 copies sold, and currently being translated into eighteen languages, <i>Fault Lines </i>is the new novel from internationally-acclaimed and best-selling author Nancy Huston. Huston's novel is a profound and poetic story that traces four generations of a single family from present-day California to WW II�Cera Germany. <i>Fault Lines</i> begins with Sol, a gifted, terrifying child whose mother believes he is destined for greatness partly because he has a birthmark like his dad, his grandmother, and his great-grandmother. When Sol's family makes an unexpected trip to Germany, secrets begin to emerge about their history during World War II. It seems birthmarks are not all that's been passed down through the bloodlines. Closely observed, lyrically told, and epic in scope, <i>Fault Lines</i> is a touching, fearless, and unusual novel about four generations of children and their parents. The story moves from the West Coast of the United States to the East, from Haifa to Toronto to Munich, as secrets unwind back through time until a devastating truth about the family's origins is reached. Huston tells a riveting, vigorous tale in which love, music, and faith rage against the shape of evil.</p><p>A native of Calgary and of New Hampshire, Nancy Huston now lives in Paris; she writes in both French and English. The author of nine novels and numerous works of nonfiction, she has won the Prix Goncourt des Lyceen, the Prix du Livre-Inter, the Prix Elle, and the Governor General&#39;s Award for Fiction in French.Gifted narrator Edwina Wren deftly juggles a handful of challenging accents and a clever plot in this story of four generations of brilliant and troubled characters. Novelist Nancy Huston&#39;s twelfth novel is told through the eyes of four children and proceeds backward from 2004 to 1944. Wren portrays each character with sensitivity and allows a tone of wonder and innocence to color her voice as she moves through the four sections of the story. The unusual structure of the book and the slow-building tension make the final revelation both startling and shocking as each of the children experiences a loss of innocence. FAULT LINES gives listeners a glimpse of the many absurdities and wonders of life. R.O.

Ishmael soon learns that Ahab seeks one specific whale, Moby Dick, a white whale of tremendous size and ferocity. Comparatively few whaleships know of Moby Dick, and fewer yet have encountered him. In a previous encounter, the whale destroyed Ahab&#39;s boat and bit off his leg. Ahab intends to take revenge.</p><p>Burt Reynolds reading this story brings expression, meaning and action to the chase of a lifetime.

During the last years of Mangas&#x2019;s life, he and his son-in-law Cochise led an assault against white settlement in Apacher�a that made the two of them the most feared warriors in the Southwest. In this first full-length biography of the legendary chief, Edwin R. Sweeney vividly portrays the Apache culture in which Mangas rose to power and the conflict with Americans that led to his brutal death.<p>A giant of a man, Mangas combined strength with wisdom and became leader of the Chiricahuas by 1842. Leading war parties against the Mexicans of Sonora, Mangas returned to his homelands in southwestern New Mexico with livestock, booty, and captives. In 1846 he welcomed Americans who joined in his fight against the Mexicans. But as more white miners, ranchers, and farmers encroached on the Apaches&#x2019; territory, tragic incidents caused retaliations that pressured Mangas, along with Cochise, to fight back in desperation. When Mangas finally tried to make peace in 1863, he was captured and killed by American soldiers. Ironically, the death of Mangas Coloradas, who had wished only to live in peace in his land, inflamed American-Apache relations and led to another twenty-three years of war.</p></p><p>Retired as a professional accountant, <b>Edwin R. Sweeney</b> is an independent scholar and the author of <i>Cochise: Chiricahua Apache Chief</i>; <i>Mangas Coloradas: Chief of the Chiricahua Apaches</i>; and <i>From Cochise to Geronimo: The Chiricahua Apaches, 1874&#x2013;1886.</i>One would expect that a biography of the great Apache leader would be sympathetic to the Native American's plight. Mangas was a prominent and influential leader of his people against the Mexicans and later the Americans who ended his life in 1863. But Sweeney's (Cochise) choice of language in his cumbersome work is appalling. Whites fighting against Apaches "killed a few Indians," "repeatedly whipped," "slain," "executed," and "dispassionately killed"; the Apaches "massacred," "murdered," "killed indiscriminately," "laid waste," "committed... depredations" and "slaughtered" troops and civilians?as if what the Apaches did in trying to protect and sustain their way of life was more heinous than what Mexicans and Americans were doing to deprive them of it. Especially dismaying is this passage describing an Apache raid: "they lanced seventy head of cattle, just for devilment" portraying them as little more than mischievous children. Understandably, any reconstruction of events will necessitate a dependence on historical documents, especially in this case with no records from the Apaches. But a historian should be careful of surmises, and the frequent use of "probably," "perhaps," "likely" and "apparently" undermines reader confidence. The writing is blase, a sluggish narrative that is little more than recounting of historical facts. Mangas Coloradas's life was anything but boring, and although well researched, this volume of his life is just that.

The full-scale treatment covers paintings, decorative panels, pastels, drawings, photographs, jewelry, and advertisements as well as numerous book and magazine illustrations. The essays elucidate Mucha's political activities in Czechoslovakia, which spawned the enormous murals "The Slav Epic"; his association with the actress Sarah Bernhardt; and the impact of American patronage on his later work.

Until his death in a 1982 motorcycle crash at age 49, Gardner suffered from neither a lack of productivity--he wrote more than 20 books--nor for want of opinions about the literary productions of others. In this collection of his essays and lectures, Gardner provides several upper-level English lit seminars&#39; worth of commentary on a number of books and authors--Melville, Roth, Oates, Styron, Calvino, Cheever, to name a few.By the time he died in a motorcycle crash in 1982, novelist John Gardner had distinguished himself as a candid, thoughtful critic of his fellow fiction writers who wasn't embarrassed to write a manifesto, On Moral Fiction (1978), that argued against purely aesthetic, formal judgments of literature. In this collection of essays and reviews, he addresses specific writers and books--e.g., John Cheever's Falconer, William Styron's Sophie's Choice, even Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland--as well as the generic problems, joys, and issues involved in the writing of fiction. Even when critical, Gardner gives his objections a contrarian twist, finding that William Gaddis' JR is not, as the common wisdom has it, an ``awesomely unreadable'' but intellectually majestic novel. Instead, he argues that JR is ``wonderfully and easily readable,'' but that in the end it is intellectually and morally lazy, concluding: ``It pays, of course, that scornful sneer; people love to be told everything stinks. It sounds so intelligent.'' -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Over the years many works have been published about the Kachinas. Most of these have discussed them from the white man's interpretation of what the Hopi have told him. This book gives readers the perspective of the Hopis.</p><p>The seventy-nine Kachinas depicted in this book were painted by Neil David, Sr., a Hopi-Tewa from First Mesa, in the village of Hano, Arizona. The paintings show both the front and back of each Kachina; that is the entire costume of the Kachina. The descriptions of the Kachinas have come from the mouths of various Hopi. They discuss differences in the Kachinas as they appear on each of the three Southwest mesas where the Hopi make their home.

Yet at the time it was installed, in 1967, and soon after accepted as the first permanent contemporary outdoor public sculpture by the City of New York, he had recieved many other public commissions, and had also been produceing smaller-scale studio sculpture of distinction for nearly two decades, first in Los Angeles and then in New York. Since the late fifties he has been experimenting in a rather wide range of abstraction, from monolithic structures to more open geometric forms, often with elegant surface detailing concerned with effects of light and movement.<br><br>Notable among Rosenthal's important commissions has been <i>Cranbrook Ingathering</i>, a maze-like structural environment set on the campus of the Michigan design center; he considers the work his homage to Charles and Ray Eames, Eero Saarinen and other modernist giants of architecture and design who had been fellows at the academy with Rosenthal. Another remarkable work that deeply stirred public attention recently is his moving <i>Holocaust Memorial</i>, made for the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo; it combines a rather austere, ten-foot high, stainless steel structure and specific texts and imagery on steel "pages" memorializing, and personalizing, the loss of the Six Million.<br><br>Since 1997 Rosenthal has embarked on a more personal method of creating abstract, yet also at time suggestively figural, sculpture consisting of small, bent stell bars shaped by hand. He has also linked these elements together and combined them almost haphazardly, creating a rich accumulation of powerfully interacting formal units. Undaunted by his advanced years, Rosenthal seems to be just getting started in his recent work, and testing new and challenging directions with vigor and concision.<br> --S.H.<br><br>The book contains 69 color plates, an extensive chronology, a list of the sculptor's major commissions and public sculptures and a bibliography.<br></p><p><b>Edward Albee</b>, a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner who, besides being one of the most celebrated and creative of playwrights, is also an art "accumulator" (his word) who spends much of his time at art galleries and the studios of artists whose work interests him.<br><br>His collection is vast, eclectic, and personal and is a strong testimony to individual taste and judgment.

A reference book, however, is much more than the sum of its pages; and in this case, the subject covered, the way it is covered, and even the way the book itself came to be are more reliable indicators of worth. </p><p>In 1990 the Chicago Area Women's History Conference (CAWHC) launched the Historical Encyclopedia of Chicago Women Project. Two years later a proposal was sent to the National Endowment for the Humanities under the auspices of the Center for Research on Women and Gender at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Editorial and advisory boards were formed, and the task of assembling an account of the lives of women integral to the history and development of the city of Chicago began. </p><p> Several criteria were established for the selection of biographees. Entrants had to have been deceased prior to December 31, 1990; played some kind of role in the history of the city; and attained some degree of accomplishment or expertise in her particular field or left writing reflecting the effects of historical events on her or on those around her. In addition, enough background information for a sizable reference entry was deemed essential. Research in the early stages of the project used <i>Women's History Sources: A Guide to Archives and Manuscript Collections in the United States</i>, by Andrea Hinding and Ames S. Bower (Bowker, 1979), to identify primary sources of information. The editors also gathered names from their own research, from historians and practitioners in various fields, and from members of ethnic communities. These efforts resulted in a database of about 3,000 names. The editorial board soon selected the first hundred names and conducted workshops for potential contributors. Contacts were made with local scholars in a variety of disciplines, professional associations, women's studies and history groups, and ethnic organizations. Even at this stage, contributors were asked to verify the existence of sufficient background material on their subjects. The entire board would eventually select 423 entries, with choices ranging from scholar and social reformer Edith Abbott (1876-1957) to pianist and teacher Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler (1863-1927). The resulting book is a fascinating collection of the life stories of a group of remarkable women, and the source notes after each entry (listing published and unpublished sources that were consulted) make it a valuable aid to further research in women's history.</p><p>An extended essay by editor Schultz--her survey of the history of women in Chicago is substantial enough to serve as a minicourse on the subject--opens the book. Rather than simply reciting the facts about each entrant, entries set each woman in historical context; and because many of the biographees are not particularly well known, this is an essential and welcome feature and one of the strengths of this work. The signed entries are arranged alphabetically, with the biographee's name in bold type followed by birth and death dates and occupations or roles in capital letters. The length of the entries varies with the subject, but most are from 2,000 to 5,000 words. Within the entries cross-references to other women included in the book are printed in capital letters the first time they are mentioned. In addition, color plates feature the work of Chicago women artists and craftswomen, and more than 100 black-and-white illustrations, ranging from formal portraits to news photos, are distributed throughout the text.</p><p>Although some of the women included here are well known, most of the entries are accounts of the lives of women who are not. Page after page tells the story of women's participation in the history of Chicago: the contributions of women to the commercial and social development of Chicago from 1790 to 1860; women's relief work in the Civil War; the movement for women's rights; women's contributions to labor, education, journalism, medicine, law, the fine arts; and more. Here one will find not only Harriet Monroe, the founder of Poetry magazine, but also Othelia Mork Myhrman, a Swedish American community activist. Charlemae Hill Rollins, eminent children's librarian and author, is represented, as is Ida Gray Nelson Rollins, the first African American woman to establish a dental practice in Chicago. Rosa Raisa, operatic soprano, and Margaret Dreier Robins, labor and social reformer, each have an entry, as do Bozena Salara, Czech missionary and teacher, and Sister Dolores Schorsch, educator and author. Famous names in broadcasting, like Fran Allison, of Kukla, Fran and Ollie fame, and Irna Phillips, creator and writer of soap operas, are profiled, as are Alice M. Peurala, trade unionist and civil rights activist, and Maria Diaz Martinez, social worker and one of the founders of Mujeres Latinas en Accion (Latin Women in Action). The index lists entries by names as well as occupation, race, ethnicity, and religion, so the reader can easily locate notable women in any of those categories. There is also a list of entries by year of birth.</p><p>Elizabeth Janeway once wrote that, "Like their personal lives, women's history is fragmented, interrupted; a shadow history of human beings whose existence has been shaped by the efforts and demands of others." Women Building Chicago, 1790-1990 gathers those fragments into a wonderful mosaic depicting the women of Chicago, whose efforts and demands have shaped life in the city as we know it today. <i>Carolyn Mulac</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His father, a poor barber-surgeon, wandered up and down Spain in search of work. Educated as a child by the Jesuits in Seville, the creator of <b>Don Quixote</b> grew up to follow the career of a professional soldier. He was wounded at Lepanto in 1571, captured by the Turks in 1575, imprisoned for five years, and was finally rescued by the Trinitarian friars in 1580. On his return to Spain he found his family more impoverished than ever before. Supporting his mother, two sisters, and an illegitimate daughter, he settled down to a literary career and had hopes of becoming a successful playwright, but just then the youthful <b>Lope de Vega</b> entered triumphantly to transform the Spanish theatre by his genius. <b>Galatea</b>, a pastoral romance, was published in 1585, the year of Cervantes&#x2019; marriage to <b>Catalina de Palacios y Salazar Vozmediano</b>. But it did not bring him an escape from poverty, and he was forced to become a roving commissary for the Spanish armada. This venture, which led to bankruptcy and jail, lasted for fifteen years. Although he never knew prosperity, Cervantes did gain a measure of fame during his lifetime, and Don Quixote and Sancho Panza were known all over the world. Part I of Don Quixote was published in 1605; in 1613, his <b>Exemplary Novels</b> appeared, and these picaresque tales of romantic adventure gained immediate popularity. <b>Journey to Parnassas</b>, a satirical review of his fellow Spanish poets, appeared in 1614, and Part II of Don Quixote in 1615 as well as <b>Eight Plays and Eight Interludes</b>.

However, those who are willing to give pk the pieces alternative readings (for example, considering the interview as a text and the interviewer as reader of that text) may find pk them intriguing as expressions of current feminist research and interpretive methodologies. Gwendolyn Etter-Lewis maintains that the speech patterns of an interviewee provide information about her life and pk opinions, and that accepting white female experience as a norm "establishes an elitism within the heart of much feminist research." Sondra Hale records her confusion as she discovers that her own politically correct stance as an interviewer in the Sudan doesn't guarantee that her subjects won't try to manipulate her for their own ends. And in an effective piece on the ethics of researching Third World women, Patai suggests that despite feminists' "sisterly posture of mutual learning," their research can reproduce the inequalities it seeks to expose.

Horton</p><h2>The Referral of a Lifetime: The Networking System That Produces Bottom-Line Results Every Day (The Ken Blanchard Series)</h2><p>In The Referral of a Lifetime, author Tim Templeton frames a powerful plan for cultivating clients and customers in a fable about businesswoman Susie McCumber, who feels increasingly like a failure. A friend refers her to the mysterious Mr. Highground, who introduces her to four successful people. They show her how they transformed their businesses and their lives by determining how others view them and how they view themselves as both human beings and businesspeople. Each of the four represents a &#34;&#34;type&#34;&#34; in this schema - from the &#34;&#34;relational/business&#34;&#34; type who puts the relationship first but thinks strategically when the talk turns to business, to the &#34;&#34;business/business&#34;&#34; type, who avoids relationships unless they work to a business advantage. Templeton shows how understanding one&#39;s type allows one to showcase strengths while improving weak areas in this simple, easy-to-use guide to success in business and in life.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why success is so easy for others but not for you? <p>Do other people know some business secret you don't? </p><p>Susie McCumber was asking herself these questions over her usual cup of dark roast coffee at the California Coffee and Bistro one morning. She was at a crossroads with her new business that had seemed, only a few months earlier, so achievable. Now she was having doubts. She was unhappy with the person she was becoming in order to achieve the success she desired. Should she return to a "safe" job she didn't like? </p><p>She had nearly resigned herself to giving up her dream of success when Chuck, the owner of the coffee shop, referred her to a mysterious person named David Michael Highground. Within 48 hours, Susie's life and business would never be the same again. </p><p>After asking Susie some unusual questions designed to see if his system's "secrets" were right for her, the mysterious Mr. Highground introduced her to four successful business people who had, at one time, been in Susie's position. Then they, too, met Mr. Highground, and their lives and businesses were dramatically transformed. One by one, they reveal the four secrets they learned from him. </p><p>What will Susie learn? Something surprisingly simple: Susie will find out she doesn't have to change at all. Indeed, before Mr. Highground's system can work, she must learn to be comfortable with who she is and the gifts she already possesses. Only then will she discover that she can be successful in business and in business relationships without ever having to make a cold call again. </p><p>In the brief time it takes to read this well written, enlightening story, you, as well as Susie, will possess the Highground insights that promise unmatched performance in any business. Meeting Mr. Highground will truly be a referral of a lifetime--for Susie, and for you!</p>This story will teach you how to: <p>* Understand and appreciate the lifetime value of relationships. </p><p>* Retain your existing clients. </p><p>* Develop and outstanding customer service program. </p><p>* Develop a referral base of clients. </p><p>* Motivate those you work with. </p><p>* Build a user-friendly and dynamic sales and marketing system.</p></p><h2>Business Now</h2><p><b><i>Business Now</i></b> focuses on business from a real-world perspective.

Leading economists evaluate the evidence for costs and benefits of various programs to help gauge how we can achieve the most good with our money. Each problem is introduced by a world-renowned expert analyzing the scale of the problem and describing the costs and benefits of a range of policy options to improve the situation. Shorter pieces from experts offering alternative positions are also included; all ten challenges are evaluated by a panel of economists from North America, Europe, and China who rank the most promising policy options. Global Crises, Global Solutions provides a serious, yet accessible, springboard for debate and discussion and will be required reading for government employees, NGOs, scholars and students of public policy and applied economics, and anyone with a serious professional or personal interest in global development issues.

His search took him to Africa, India, and East Asia, to the National Institutes of Mental Health, and to the mountains of Appalachia. What he discovered is both surprising and controversial: There is no true increase in autism. Grinker shows that the identification and treatment of autism depends on culture just as much as on science. As more and more cases of autism are documented, doctors are describing the disorder better, school systems are coding it better--and children are benefiting. Filled with moving stories and informed by the latest science, <i>Unstrange Minds</i> is unlike any other book on autism. It is a powerful testament to a father's quest for the truth, and is urgently relevant to anyone whose life is touched by one of history's most puzzling disorders.</p><p><b>Roy Richard Grinker</b> is Professor of Anthropology and Director, George Washington University Institute for Ethnographic Research. He is the author of four other books, including the widely acclaimed In the Arms of Africa: The Life of Colin M. Turnbull.

He lives in Cabin John, Maryland.Autism is no longer considered a rare, stigmatized disorder; it's one that touches the lives of an increasing number of individuals worldwide. Grinker, director of the George Washington University Institute for Ethnographic Research, is one example of this phenomenon. Driven by the 1994 autism diagnosis his daughter, Isabel, received, Grinker endeavors to collect the myriad scientific, historical and cultural components of autism into an accessible primer. The book is divided into two parts&#x2014;academic and anecdotal&#x2014;throughout which the author illustrates his daughter's development and how his family has coped and developed alongside her. The first section recounts the history of autism, from the illness's initial description in 1943, its once taboo status and the erroneously cited causes of autism. Special attention is given to the evolving diagnostic criteria and the increase in prevalence rates. In the emotionally powerful second portion, Grinker details the experiences of parents of autistic children in South Africa, South Korea and India, how their respective societies view the disorder (often negatively) and the obstacles surmounted to increase awareness of autism, its treatment and management. While this grounds the book, the lengths to which Grinker goes to prove to the parents of autistic children they are not alone needn't have been so extensive. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dewdney revealed the alarming shenanigans of those who use "bad math" to deceive us. Now he turns his sharp-witted eye on the practitioners of "bad science" and offers an equally amusing and informative tour of the often odd, sometimes disturbing mistakes scientists make. Dewdney profiles eight notorious cases of bad science, revealing fundamental errors from the subtle to the ridiculous, including claims hailing from major research centers backed by millions of dollars of funding. We learn the inside scoop about the infamous fusion fiasco, scrutinize the strange saga of the media-hyped Biosphere, probe the appealing but flawed logic of the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence, and much more.<br> Written in Dewdney's trademark humorous style and full of intriguing and eye-opening facts and figures<br> A.K.

Dewdney colorfully explains in <i>Yes, We Have No Neutrons</i>, bad science has a long and (un)distinguished history. Predicating his discussion on Langmuir's "Laws of Bad Science," which describes common characteristics of dubious scientific claims, Dewdney recounts such classic scientific blunders as the "discovery" of N rays by Ren� Blondlot, psychoanalysis as practiced by Sigmund Freud, and even the ill-fated Biosphere 2 experiment. (Yes, cold fusion is there, too.) Dewdney's book will sharpen the mental razor of anyone who hopes to separate legitimate claims from bunk.&#34;Bad Science&#34; is a popular topic among trade science readers, and this book tells the stories of eight notorious cases of &#34;bad science;&#34; research projects that turned out to be faulty, either because of bad methodology or mistaken interpretations of results. Dissects the ways science can be badly done, even when no deception is intended and the best scientists are involved, also explains the true characteristics of good science.

They range from hauntingly tragedy on the snow-capped peak of Kilimanjaro, to brutal America with its deceptive calm, and war-ravaged Europe.</p><p>Returning from a Kenyan safari in 1932, Ernest Hemingway quickly devised a literary trophy to add to his stash of buffalo hides and rhino horns. To this day, <i>Green Hills of Africa</i> seems an almost perverse paean to the thrills of bloodshed, in which the author cuts one notch after another in his gun barrel and declares, "I did not mind killing anything." Four years later, however, Hemingway came up with a more accomplished spin on his African experiences--a pair of them, in fact, which he collected with eight other tales in <i>The Snows of Kilimanjaro</i>. The title story is a meditation on corruption and mortality, two subjects that were already beginning to preoccupy the 37-year-old author. As the protagonist perishes of gangrene out in the bush, he recognizes his own failure of nerve as a writer: <blockquote>Now he would never write the things that he had saved to write until he knew enough to write them well. Well, he would not have to fail at trying to write them either. Maybe you could never write them, and that was why you put them off and delayed the starting. Well he would never know, now.</blockquote> In the story, at least, the hero gets some points for stoic acceptance, as well as an epiphanic vision of Kilimanjaro's summit, "wide as all the world, great, high, and unbelievably white in the sun." (The movie version is another matter: Gregory Peck makes it back to the hospital, loses a leg, and is a better person for it.) But Hemingway's <i>other</i> great white hunter, in "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber," is granted a less dignified exit. This time the issue is cowardice, another of Papa's bugaboos: poor Francis is too wimpy to face down a wounded lion, let alone satisfy his treacherous wife in bed. Yet he does manage a last-minute triumph before dying--an absolute assertion of courage--which makes the title a hair less ironic than it initially seems. No wonder these are two of the highest-caliber (so to speak) tales in the Hemingway canon. <i>--Bob Brandeis</i>The ideal introduction to the genius of Ernest Hemingway, The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories contains ten of Hemingway&#39;s most acclaimed and popular works of short fiction. Selected from Winner Take Nothing, Men Without Women, and The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories, this collection includes &#34;The Killers&#34;, the first of Hemingway&#39;s mature stories to be accepted by an American periodical; the autobiographical &#34;Fathers and Sons&#34;, which alludes, for the first time in Hemingway&#39;s career, to his father&#39;s suicide; &#34;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&#34;, a &#34;brilliant fusion of personal observation, hearsay and invention&#34;, wrote Hemingway&#39;s biographer, Carlos Baker; and the title story itself, of which Hemingway said: &#34;I put all the true stuff in&#34;, with enough material, he boasted, to fill four novels. Beautiful in their simplicity, startling in their originality, and unsurpassed in their craftsmanship, the stories in this volume highlight one of America&#39;s master storytellers at the top of his form.</p><h2>88 Poems</h2><p>Spanning a thirty-eight-year period, from Hemingway&#39;s first poem published when he was twelve to private verses sent to Mary Welsh Hemingway in 1950, these lyrics, parodies, and satires touch on themes that range from war and love to contemporary literature</p><p></p><h2>Engineering Circuit Analysis</h2><p>Well known for its clear explanations, challenging problems, and abundance of drill exercises which effectively instill intuitive understanding in students, the new edition of this best-selling textbook for the sophomore circuits course offers new chapters on state variable analysis, improved coverage of operational amplifiers, new problems using SPICE, and new worked-examples and end-of-chapter problems.</p><p></p><h2>History of Modern Art: Painting Sculpture Architecture Photography</h2><p><p>Long considered <i>the</i> survey of modern art, this engrossing and liberally illustrated text traces the development of trends and influences in painting, sculpture, photography and architecture from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day.

The delightfully various figures in <i>The Old Curiosity Shop </i>range memorably from jaunty Dick Swiveller and his little half-starved Marchioness to the hard-hearted siblings Sampson and Sally Brass, jovial Mrs. Jarley, devoted Kit Nubbles, the hunchbacked Daniel Quilp, and, of course, tragic Little Nell herself. Dickens&#x2019;s depiction of the fate of his main characters is famously harrowing and unfailingly suspenseful, but not the least of its charms is that it is embellished with a supporting cast of figures as grotesque and colorful as anything in the Old Curiosity Shop itself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>This edition reprints the original Everyman&#x2019;s preface by G. K. Chesterton and features seventy-five illustrations by Cattermole and Phiz.<br></p></p><p>The sound of Little Nell clattering hurriedly over cobblestones immediately sets the stage by bringing to mind the narrow and dangerous streets of Victorian London. No fewer than 20 performers are called upon to conjure up the Dickensian world of wanderers, ne'er-do-wells, con artists, and kind Samaritans--and each performance is excellent. Tom Courtenay plays the sadistic Quilp, "the ugliest dwarf that could be seen anywhere for a penny" with magnificent sarcastic glee, and Teresa Gallagher's silvery, childlike voice is ideally suited for the role of the angelic Little Nell.<p> Nell is on her way home to the dusty shop where she and her grandfather live a rather mysterious life. The old man disappears every night--visiting gambling dens with the naive hope of winning a fortune. Instead he sinks deeper and deeper into debt. Enter Daniel Quilp, moneylender, who becomes furious upon learning that the grandfather is a pauper and will never be able to repay his tremendous debt. Quilp seizes the curiosity shop and begins making lecherous overtures to Nell, so she and her grandfather steal away one morning to seek their fortunes elsewhere. But the demonic dwarf is never far behind.</p><p> Sound effects are employed judiciously and serve mainly as a springboard for the listener's imagination. The sound of a crying baby is enough to convey the image of crowded lodgings and genteel Victorian poverty, while raucous laughter and high-pitched squawks evoke the barely controlled chaos of an outdoor Punch and Judy show. The dramatization pares Dickens's weighty novel down to two and one-half hours, but does so skillfully, retaining Dickens's wit, marvelous dialogue, and delightful characterizations.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>Drawing Life: Surviving the Unabomber</h2><p>A bombing victim examines the benefits to society of acknowledging the Unabomber&#39;s evil, and shares the ways in which religion and family have helped him to heal from his experience</p><p>In 1993, Yale computer science professor David Gelernter opened what he thought was an unsolicited doctoral dissertation. It exploded, destroying his right hand and eye and making his torso resemble a construction site. Gelernter, bleeding and "royally annoyed," walked to the local hospital, keeping his feet trudging along in time with "an old Zionist marching song with a good strong beat." When he got there, his blood pressure measured zero and surgeons barely saved his life. "Music is useful," Gelernter observes.<p> While doctors rebuilt Gelernter, he published three books. In this one, Gelernter talks about getting blown up and sewn up and vehemently argues that society is losing its lifeblood--its belief in moral authority. He blames this on the takeover of the national mindset by the liberal intellectual elite, whose anything-goes ethic has silenced the drumbeat of tradition that used to keep us all in line. Though he doesn't directly blame the intellectual liberals for the Unabomber's actions, he does locate the madman on a continuum of modern social degradation. <i>Drawing Life</i> is an impassioned, not tightly reasoned argument and will make few converts to Gelernter's brand of conservatism. It's interesting as all get out though, with lots of clever lines and quirky insights. It's a good thing the Unabomber didn't silence Gelernter--a stubborn mind is a terrible thing to waste.</p>David Gelernter is Associate Professor of Computer Science at Yale University.</p><h2>Meetings with Remarkable Trees</h2><p>An award-winning historian and renowned arborist offers a profusely illustrated survey of sixty distinctive, outstanding trees from Britain and Ireland, containing literate, colorful descriptions of the trees&#39; characters, color photographs, and maps.</p><p>Thomas Pakenham, a distinguished historian of Africa, takes a new tack by writing an old-fashioned kind of book: a catalog of trees of the British Isles. The last such book was published in 1826. In <i>Meetings with Remarkable Trees</i> Pakenham assembles a beautifully photographed gallery of 60-odd trees of Scotland, England, and Ireland, and magnificent trees they are. One is a 600-year-old king oak that looms large over Charleville, Ireland; another is the yew tree that Wordsworth called the "pride of Lorton's vale"; still another is a sequoia brought from the United States and planted in a Herefordshire grove in 1851, where it has since flourished. Pakenham helpfully includes a map showing the locations of his scattered dramatis personae; you could make a fine tour retracing his steps and having a look for yourself.Thomas Pakenham is the author of the critically acclaimed The Scramble for Africa which won the W.H. Smith Award and the Alan Paton Award. He is also the author of The Boer War, The Mountains of Rasselas and The Year of Liberty. He lives in County Westmeath, Ireland and is chairman of the Irish Tree Society.

If she could not personally do something in her classroom, then she didn't advocate it for others. Likewise, if her colleagues found something cumbersome or impractical, she substituted a "working" idea. <b> </b> Organized into four parts, this book helps teachers address diversity in the classroom, construct a knowledge of science, develop pedagogical content knowledge, and teach with thematic units.

(The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A lexicon and guide for discovering the essence of landscape.</b></p><p><b>&#x201c;Mr. Stilgoe does not ask that we take his book outdoors with us; he believes that reading and experiencing landscapes are activities that should be kept separate.

I recommend you stow your copy there.&#x201d;<br></b><b><i>&#x2015;The Wall Street Journal</i></b></p><p>Landscape, John Stilgoe tells us, is a noun. From the old Frisian language (once spoken in coastal parts of the Netherlands and Germany), it meant shoveled land: <i>landschop</i>. Sixteenth-century Englishmen misheard or mispronounced this as <i>landskep</i>, which became<i> landskip</i>, then <i>landscape</i>, designating the surface of the earth shaped for human habitation. In <i>What Is Landscape?</i> Stilgoe maps the discovery of landscape by putting words to things, zeroing in on landscape's essence but also leading sideways expeditions through such sources as children's picture books, folklore, deeds, antique terminology, out-of-print dictionaries, and conversations with locals. (&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, it's not really a slough, not really, it's a bayou...&#x201d;) He offers a highly original, cogent, compact, gracefully written narrative lexicon of landscape as word, concept, and path to discoveries.</p><p><i>What Is Landscape? </i>is an invitation to walk, to notice, to ask: to see a sandcastle with a pinwheel at the beach and think of Dutch windmills&#x2015;icons of triumph, markers of territory won from the sea; to walk in the woods and be amused by the Elizabethans' misuse of the Latin <i>silvaticus </i>(people of the woods) to coin the word <i>savages</i>; to see in a suburban front lawn a representation of the meadow of a medieval freehold.</p><p>Discovering landscape is good exercise for body and for mind.

The work, a series of twenty-one black-and-white photographs, twenty-four text panels and three blank panels, embraces the codes of the photo-text experiments of the late 1960s and applies them to the social reality of New York's Lower East Side. The prevailing critical view of<i> The Bowery</i> focuses on its implicit rejection, or critique, of established modes of documentary. In this illustrated, extended essay on the work by Rosler, Steve Edwards argues that although the critical attitude towards documentary is an important dimension of the piece, it does not exhaust the meaning of the project.</p><p>Edwards situates the work in relation to debates and practices of the period, especially conceptual art and the emergence of the photo-text paradigm exemplified by the work of Robert Smithson, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Hans Haacke, Victor Burgin, and the Women and Work group. In particular, he contextualizes Rosler's work of this period within the politicized San Diego group (which included, in addition to Rosler, Allan Sekula, Fred Lonidier, and Philip Steinmetz). Comparing <i>The Bowery</i> to Rosler's later video <i>vital statistics of a citizen</i>, <i>simply obtained </i>(1977) and the films of the Dziga-Vertov Group (formed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin), Edwards shows how the work engages with conceptual art and the neo-avant-garde of the 1960s and 1970s.</p></p><p>Steve Edwards is a Lecturer in Art History at the Open University.

The study looks at the international context of the war and the exodus, and describes the political battle over the refugees&#39; fate, which effectively ended with the deadlock at Lausanne in summer 1949.

Like the Grimm brothers before her, Laura Gonzenbach, a talented Swiss-German born in Sicily, set out to gather up the tales told and retold among the peasants. Gonzenbach collected wonderful stories - some on subjects that readers will know from the Grimms or Perrault, some entirely new - and published them in German. Her early death and the destruction of her papers in the Messina earthquake of 1908 only add to the mystery behind her achievement. Beautiful Angiola is an instant classic: a nineteenth-century collection of stories in the great tradition of fairy and folk tales now translated into English for the first time. Gonzenbach delights us with heroines and princes, sorcery and surprise, the deeds of the brave and the treacherous, and the magic of the true storyteller. The Green Bird , The Humiliated Princess , sorfarina , The Magic Cane, the Golden Donkey, and the Little Stick that Hits are titles destine to become new favourites for readers everywhere. Yet while the stories enchant us, the wry taglines with which they often end (&#34;And so they remained rich and consoled, while we keep sitting here and are getting old&#34;) gently bring us back to earth.</p><p><strong>Jack Zipes</strong> is Professor of German at the University of Minnesota.

Apparently a native of Greek Alexandria in Egypt, he was, to judge by his name, of Roman descent, though his first writings were in Greek, and his pure Latin may have been learned by him as a foreign language. About 395 CE he moved to Italy (Milan and Rome) and though really a pagan, became a professional court-poet composing for Christian rulers works which give us important knowledge of Honorius's time.</p><p>A panegyric on the brothers Probinus and Olybrius (consuls together in 395) was followed during ten years by other poems (mostly epics in hexameters): in praise of consulships of Honorius (395, 398, 404 CE); against the Byzantine ministers Rufinus (396) and Eutropius (399); in praise of the consulship (400) of Stilicho (Honorius's guardian, general, and minister); in praise of Stilicho's wife Serena; mixed metres on the marriage of Honorius to their daughter Maria; on the war with the rebel Gildo in Africa (398); on the Getic or Gothic war (402); on Stilicho's success against the Goth Alaric (403); on the consulship of Manlius Theodorus (399); and on the wedding of Palladius and Celerina. Less important are non-official poems such as the three books of a mythological epic on the Rape of Proserpina, unfinished as was also a Battle of Giants (in Greek).

Nothing is known of him after 404.

Much debate has gone into what constitutes erotic literature; but whether the novel was about a scandalous affair or a quest for purity, or about the class system and social conflict, one needs to read it for oneself to find the message that lies within. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>*&nbsp;This chic and inexpensive edition comes with a heat-burnished cover, foil stamping, luxurious endpapers, and a smaller trim size that&#x2019;s easy to hold.<br>*&nbsp;<i>Lady Chatterly&#x2019;s Lover</i> is a hallmark of sensual literary prose. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>Lady Chatterly&#x2019;s Lover</i> will surely pique the interest and curiosity of the most discerning of readers. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>About the Word Cloud Classics series:<br><br>Classic works of literature with a clean, modern aesthetic!
